Despite their biological importance, studies with membrane proteins have been hampered by difficulties involved in purification of these proteins. Since most studies with membrane proteins require that these proteins to be in a membrane-like environment, a variety of membrane mimicking systems have been developed, which adds another layer of complexity. This project will develop a novel and innovative approach that will significantly advance knowledge in the field of membrane proteins by providing a method that can characterize them in their native lipid environment in living cells. The method will first be developed using a well-characterized cytostolic protein as a model system and then the membrane protein angiomotin will be used as a model system for the study of transmembrane proteins. The project will provide a gateway to understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of membrane trafficking. This project will provide training for students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in an eight week undergraduate summer program to provide STEM research opportunities. These students will be trained in consecutive summers and become mentors in their last year. The project will also provide training to pre-and post-doctoral students.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the development of an in cell protein footprinting method coupled with mass spectrometry for the characterization of protein interactions inside the cell. A major hindrance in studying protein-lipid interactions is simulating the membrane environment of the cell. The approach this project develops will lead significant advances in studies of membrane proteins by providing a method that can characterize them in their native cellular environment. The method, which uses ""caged hydrogen peroxide"", will first be developed using a well-characterized cytosolic protein as a model system. Parameters of the method will be systematically optimized and quantitative benchmarks will be used to determine success. Statistical analysis will be used to validate the significance in observed changes in protein modification. Then the membrane protein angiomotin will be used as a model system for the study of transmembrane proteins. This project will result in the development of a novel analytical method for the study of proteins in the cellular environment in living cells. The method will allow for the study of membrane proteins that cannot be studied by currently available structural methods and provide new insight into membrane trafficking in cellular environment.","11/04/2016","11/04/2016","1701692","Lisa","Jones","ljones@rx.umaryland.ed","11/04/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Maryland at Baltimore","Baltimore","212011508","4107063559","620 W Lexington St, 4th Floor","United States","Maryland","MD","1144","Molecular Biophysics","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","1144","BIOMOLECULAR SYSTEMS","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scheiner","This award will provide support for the annual Clinic on Dynamic Approaches to Infectious Disease Data to be held in December, 2016, that will provide training for U.S. scientists in the mathematics of infectious disease epidemiology. Mathematics and simulation are essential tools in infectious disease control, enabling decision-makers to explore control policies before implementing them, interpret trends, and predict emerging threats. Over the past decade, integration of the fields of mathematical epidemiology and biomedical epidemiology has increased in research practice; however, training options provide few opportunities for integration in the classroom. This clinic addresses this gap by offering participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. The clinic will provide a conceptual foundation for integrating dynamic modeling approaches with empirical infectious diseases research. It is aimed at participants without substantial experience in scientific computing or in mathematical modeling. The training will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing applied problems in infectious disease research. This training will prepare participants to pursue their research goals after the clinic. Participants will develop the skills necessary to identify which research questions can and cannot benefit from development of a dynamic modeling program. In addition, because the clinic will also include scientists from Africa it will provide opportunities for U.S. scientists to build a network of international collaborators. In addition, lectures will be made publicly available online so that they can be used for self-instruction by those unable to attend the clinic or incorporated into teaching materials for other courses.","10/21/2016","10/21/2016","1700060","Juliet","Pulliam","pulliam@ufl.edu","10/21/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","ATHENS","306021589","7065425939","310 East Campus Rd","United States","Georgia","GA","7242","ECOLOGY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Steven","Bellan","steve.bellan@uga.edu","10/21/2016","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, the data sets we collect are frequently highly inter-correlated, reflecting information about the same or similar/related entities in the world, or echoing semantically important repetitions/symmetries or hierarchical structures common to both man-made and natural objects. This project will assist scientists and engineers working with correlated data sets in getting the most information and value out of their data. Key to the approach is the idea of joint data analysis, the notion that each piece of data is best understood not in isolation but in the context provided by its peers and partners in a collection of related data sets, using the web of relationships referred to above. The key aim is to complement the social networks of scientists and engineers as they exist today with parallel networks that interlink the data they base their work on, using domain-specific semantic links and aiming at mechanisms that allow algorithmic transport of information between data used by scientists working in the same domain. The resulting system amplifies scientific insights by allowing an observation of one scientist on one piece of data to automatically be transported to other relevant data sets and aggregated and also enables the automated discovery of shared structures or common abstractions that can inform multiple data sets.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this joint analysis this project interconnects data sets into networks along which information can be transported and aggregated. These data set links are based on efficient matching algorithms using domain-specific features. In the associated setting, these matching or maps are used not to estimate distances or similarities but to build operators that can transport information between different data sets. The research team will exploit a functional analytic framework that allows for encoding of information as functions over the data and leads to linear operators for mapping, enabling the use of many powerful tools from linear algebra and optimization. Using inspiration from homological algebra, this team will join multiple related data sets into networks connected through these operators in a way that allows information transport, correction, and aggregation, with the ultimate goal of using the ""wisdom of the collection"" to provide as much information as possible for specific data sets to specific scientists.","10/13/2016","10/13/2016","1700234","Qixing","Huang","huangqx@cs.utexas.edu","10/13/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","8069","CDS&E-MSS","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)","8084","CDS&E","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the ultimate goal in many information-processing tasks is to infer some parameters of interest, that govern the statistical and physical model of the data. This includes applications ranging from source localization in radar and imaging systems to inferring latent variables in machine learning. The number of parameters in such problems is much smaller than the acquired volume of data, which leads to the possibility of more intelligent ways of sensing high dimensional signals, that can exploit the statistical model of the signal (with or without invoking sparsity), and the physics of the problem. The objective of this project is to develop a systematic theory of smart sampling and information retrieval algorithms for modern sensing systems that exploit the correlation structure of high dimensional signals to significantly reduce the number of measurements needed for inference. The proposed research can lead to deployment of fewer sensors (than what is traditionally required), as well as more energy efficient ways to collect and process spatio-temporal data that will positively impact a number of applications across disciplines, such as, high resolution imaging, remote sensing, neural signal processing and wireless communication. The educational component of this project aims at integrating the research outcomes into innovative teaching platforms such as ''Sense Smarter'', and ''Signals Everywhere'' that will help train the next generation of electrical engineers, and encourage them to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The technical component of the project has three interconnected goals: (i) designing fundamentally new geometries for correlation-aware samplers that exploit the statistical as well as physical signal models, (ii) developing, and analyzing the performance of new correlation driven algorithms to understand fundamental capabilities of correlation-aware samplers, and (iii) exploiting the ideas behind correlation-aware samplers to develop more efficient algorithms for solving bi- and multi-linear problems. Design of these samplers will provide new theoretical insights into properties of quadratic samplers, and will help address fundamental mathematical questions that can be of independent interest. The samplers also facilitate the development of new inference strategies, and the proposed rigorous theoretical analysis of these algorithms is expected to fundamentally advance our current understanding of the limits of parameter estimation from compressed data. Finally, the ideas behind correlation-aware samplers have strong connections with problems in machine learning such as dictionary learning, and latent variable analysis, and they will foster future research advances in these areas.","10/20/2016","10/20/2016","1700506","Piya","Pal","pipal@eng.ucsd.edu","10/20/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","7564","COMMS, CIRCUITS & SENS SYS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","153E","Wireless comm & sig processing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Baheti","Networks are increasingly becoming a powerful tool to model and analyze the properties of naturally occurring and engineered interacting dynamic systems. In a wide range of applications, networked dynamical systems theory provides a coherent framework to model phenomena such as the emergence of highly structured or synchronized global behavior, or to analyze the possibility of altering the natural dynamics in a collection of decentralized interacting dynamic systems. In both natural and man-made systems, the presence of inherent network structures may explain the onset of collective behavior or inhibit the possibility of freely controlling the dynamics of the system. Although such structures are mathematically rare, they appear widely in real-world networks such as yeast protein interactions and human B cell genetic networks, technological networks such as the Western States US power grid, US airports, the Internet, and social networks such as email and academic collaboration networks. From a controls design perspective, it is therefore imperative to fully understand for a networked dynamic system how the local structure of the network affects the ability to control or alter its dynamic behavior and to develop algorithms that avoid undesirable control intervention. The proposed research will provide STEM training for students at a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a predominantly minority population. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will involve students from several STEM disciplines such as electrical engineering, applied mathematics, and computer science. <br/><br/>The existing body of knowledge on the relationship between network structure and the ability to control the dynamics of a multi-agent system has fallen behind in addressing the need to control ever more complex networks in engineering and naturally occurring systems. The objective of this research is to advance our understanding of how the topological structure of a networked multi-agent dynamic system governs the selection of a group of agents to alter the behavior of the overall system and accomplish system-level tasks such as state transfer or regulation. The methods used in the proposed research will blend techniques from mathematical control theory, algebraic graph theory and matrix analysis, and scientific computing. Outcomes of the research will include a catalog of new network structures directly related with the ability to control a given networked dynamic system, and efficient algorithms to detect these structures and their demonstration in real-world technological and biological networks. The expected results will add to the development of a usable theory of the control of networked multi-agent systems. This research will also make new connections with control theory and algebraic graph theory. From a practical standpoint, one of the impacts of this research will be to provide control design engineers and scientists with a broad overview of the controllability profile of a given network and its effect on designing decentralized control protocols.","10/24/2016","10/24/2016","1700578","Cesar","Aguilar","aguilar@geneseo.edu","10/24/2016","Principal Investigator","SUNY College at Geneseo","Geneseo","144541401","5852455547","1 College Circle","United States","New York","NY","7607","ENERGY,POWER,ADAPTIVE SYS","092E","Control systems & applications","155E","Electric power networks",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, in the sentence ""What do you see?"" the question word ""what"" parallels the object in the answer: we say ""I see a car"", so ""what"" corresponds to the thing that we see. The word ""what"" appears to start after the verb, but moves to the front of the sentence. This study will examine grammatical constraints on this displacement in languages where the grammatical subject can appear in two different forms depending on whether the verb is intransitive (e.g., ""run"") or transitive (e.g., ""eat""): ergative languages. In most ergative languages, the subject of a transitive cannot displace at all. Linguists do not know why; perhaps it has to do with the difficulty in processing such displacement. To test this, the researchers will use eye-tracking to investigate whether this displacement is particularly difficult in the few ergative languages that can move both kinds of subjects (such languages are about 10% of all ergative languages). Avar, a minority language of the Caucasus, has already been investigated. In this project, they propose to study Niuean, an endangered Polynesian language spoken mainly in New Zealand. The choice of Niuean is critical because its structure is the mirror image of Avar structure and will allow researchers to fill in an important gap in the understanding of ergativity. That in turn will lead to novel ways of modeling the structure of complex sentences and long-distance relations in natural language. If these studies of ergative languages show that speakers pay attention to the notion of grammatical subject, regardless of its form, this would constitute novel confirmation that the abstract notion ?subject? is psychologically real. <br/><br/>Few minority languages have been studied using experimental methods, so this study will set an important precedent for combining experimental methods with field linguistics. The research team will be working with the National Maori Language Institute, with the Faculty of Maori Development (Te Ara Poutama) at Auckland University of Technology, and with colleagues at the University of Auckland. Graduate and undergraduate assistants will be given the opportunity to work on the project and interact with the Niuean community in Auckland and will therefore be exposed to the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Polynesian world.","10/24/2016","10/24/2016","1700662","Maria","Polinsky","polinsky@fas.harvard.edu","10/24/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Maryland College Park","COLLEGE PARK","207425141","3014056269","3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive","United States","Maryland","MD","1311","LINGUISTICS","1311","LINGUISTICS","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION","7719","DEL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, the project will examine two application areas: autonomous robots and educational agents that interact with human students to facilitate learning. The principal technical development investigated in this project will center around applications of deep neural networks (deep learning) to efficiently learn predictive models of the world, such as the physical environment of the robot or the behavior of a human student using an interactive educational agent. Deep learning has enabled impressive advances in passive perception domains such as computer vision and speech recognition, but typically requires very large amounts of data to succeed. This is often a major challenge in interactive settings, where a robot cannot interact with its environment for weeks or months just to learn a single behavior. To address this challenge, this project will investigate how predictive models can be transferred from prior tasks into a new task. The technologies developed as part of this project could enable substantially more sophisticated autonomous systems that can adapt quickly to new situations through transfer. Economic impact could include new consumer robotics products and improved education through intelligent automation.<br/><br/>Reinforcement learning holds the promise of automating complex decision making and control in the presence of uncertainty. For a wide range of real-world problems, from robotic control and autonomous vehicles to interactive educational tools, this would provide dramatic improvements in capability and reduction in engineering cost. However, applying reinforcement learning to complex, unstructured environments and real-world problems with raw inputs, such as images and sounds, remains tremendously difficult. Deep learning has shown a great deal of promise for tackling complex learning problems, especially ones that require parsing high-dimensional, raw sensory signals, but the most successful applications of deep learning use very large amounts of labeled data. This is at odds with the demands of reinforcement learning, where the goal is typically to learn an effective policy using the minimal amount of interaction. This projects aims to address this challenge by developing algorithms for model-based deep reinforcement learning, where a generalizable model is learned from past experience on related but different tasks, and then transferred to a new task to learn it very quickly, directly using raw sensory inputs.","10/24/2016","10/24/2016","1700697","Sergey","Levine","sergey.levine@gmail.com","10/24/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7923","SMALL PROJECT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Goldfield","Rigoberto Hernandez of Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to develop theoretical and simulation approaches that advance our fundamental understanding of suspensions of colloidal particles. A colloid is a solution containing particles ranging between one to one thousand nanometers, evenly distributed throughout the solution. Some examples from everyday life are blood, mayonnaise, soaps and gels. These particles interact at the coarser scale of colloid particle-colloid particle interactions and at the finer scale of molecular interactions. These interactions remain poorly understood with respect to their movement. The computational methods being developed through this work provide a new set of design tools for materials with desired colloidal properties. The research combines the development of appropriate models and theories to provide insight on the behavior of moving colloidal particle and the direct application of these models and theories to several interesting and important experimental systems. Professor Hernandez is involved in efforts to broaden the use of theoretical and computational tools in chemical dynamics beyond its practitioners, and to increase the learning and appreciation of chemistry in the education of undergraduate students and graduate students both in and out of the classroom. He also engages the general public, and helps diversify the chemical work force. His research findings are disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications, blog posts on EveryWhereChem, and scientific and public lectures.<br/><br/>This research integrates computational and theoretical tools to characterize the generic dynamics of chemical events in nonequilibrium environments far from equilibrium, and investigates the dynamics of complex nonequilibrium chemical systems. The research group studies specific chemical systems (Janus and striped colloids with spherical and ellipsoidal geometries and soft materials) whose nonequilibrium dynamics can be directly tested and predicted by experiment.

A major question is whether surfaces can generally be interpreted/categorized in terms of a bulk repulsive surface that includes attractive ?heterodomains? of given size and spatial frequency (surface coverage). Specifically, it is unknown whether characterizing surfaces in this way allows prediction of colloid transport in porous media under unfavorable conditions. This discrete heterogeneity model predicts (and experiments indicate) that a fraction of colloids in the fluid surrounding a porous media grain will spend long residence times in the near-surface fluid due to weak attractive interactions, which raises another fundamental question: how do the long residence times of colloids in the near-surface fluid under unfavorable conditions influence transport behavior at the Darcy scale? What scale-up strategies are needed to recognize the influence of long near-surface residence times? We posit that these long near-surface residence times yield incomplete mixing of colloids across the fluid domain, necessitating memory function/multirate or correlated random walk approaches to upscaling. Our recently-developed mechanistic model with heterodomains captures colloid transport and retention behavior at the pore scale under unfavorable conditions. This model will serve as the platform from which to scale up predictions to the Darcy scale under unfavorable conditions. The model results will be compared to experimental results for colloid transport in an impinging jet and in porous media for a range of colloid sizes, solution ionic strengths, and fluid velocities. We anticipate producing a mechanistic model that will predict the extent and mode of colloid retention under unfavorable conditions. <br/><br/>This project will represent unfavorable surfaces in numerical models of colloid transport in order to provide mechanistic prediction of colloid retention during transport in porous media. The results of this mechanistic model will be used to explore the influence of colloid-surface interaction on strategies to upscale transport prediction from the pore to the Darcy scale. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict colloid transport under environmental conditions, in contexts such as pathogen transport in the environment, and targeted delivery of bacteria with novel metabolic properties.","10/24/2016","10/24/2016","1700766","Markus","Hilpert","mh3632@columbia.edu","10/24/2016","Principal Investigator","Columbia University","NEW YORK","100276902","2128546851","2960 Broadway","United States","New York","NY","1579","HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project studies the global structure of Kahler manifolds. In particular, conjectures on the uniformization of Kahler manifolds will be addressed. These conjectures generalize the classical uniformization theorem in one complex variable. In the PI's project, there are many interactions among several branches of mathematics, e.g. algebraic geometry, analysis, topology and differential geometry. Wider applications of the PI's field include the structure of molecules, the large scale structure of the universe and the liquid gas boundary. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to work on three projects which involve function theory and geometry on Kahler manifolds. The first project is to study problems which are closely related to the uniformization conjecture of Yau. These problems include the finite generation of the ring of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth, sharp dimension estimates for holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and a conjecture of Ni on the equivalence between average curvature decay, maximal volume growth and the existence of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth. In the second project, the PI will seek obstructions to Kahler metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature. The PI also plans to show that the Kodaira dimension of compact Kahler manifolds with nonpositive bisectional curvature is a homotopy invariant.

Palka","Abstract (Lu, 1301595)<br/><br/>The proposed research project includes solving problems in two main directions: sharp geometric inequalities and multiparameter harmonic analysis. Recent developments in the area of sharp geometric inequalities include best constants for Moser-Trudinger inequalities on the entire Heisenberg group and more general Carnot groups and Adams inequalities on high order Sobolev spaces on unbounded domains in Euclidean spaces. These are circumstances where symmetrization properties do not hold. The PI, in collaboration with his PhD students, have very recently succeeded in developing a rearrangement-free argument. This new method suggests that such sharp geometric inequalities can be established in more general scenarios including Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, the PI will investigate the existence of extremal functions for these sharp geometric inequalities where many challenging problems still remain open. Another main direction of research is to develop multiparameter harmonic analysis function space theory in several complicated but important multiparameter settings. The PI, in collaboration with others, has developed a satisfactory theory of discrete Littlewood-Paley square functions in a number of multiparameter scenarios. However, there are still many other important multiparameter settings where such a discrete Littlewood-Paley theory is yet to be established. <br/><br/>Multi parameter Harmonic analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations are central areas of modern mathematics. Findings and new tools discovered in this project may lead to new development in the area of classical harmonic analysis, partial differential equations as well as other branches of mathematics. They have many applications in sciences and engineering. The solution to the proposed project will have impact on many other disciplines, including mechanics engineering (such as vibration and noise reduction for vehicles), imaging processing and pattern recognitions in medical sciences, stochastic control and optimization, game theory, chemical combustion, human vision and other topics in the life and medical sciences. Moreover, this project has a substantial training and educational component. It finely integrates research together with education.

Anderson","This study will investigate the impacts of convective and stratiform processes on tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change through analysis of mesoscale observations, with a focus on aircraft and Doppler radar data. Our ability to skillfully predict changes in TC intensity is still limited, but recent studies have suggested that the radial location of deep convective bursts and stratiform precipitation relative to the radius of maximum wind (RMW) may play an important role in intensification efficiency. Testing these new hypotheses using mesoscale observations is needed to diagnose the most important physical processes responsible for intensity change and improve TC intensity forecasts.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Analysis of Doppler radar, dropsonde, satellite, and other observations will be used to examine TC convective and stratiform structures, their thermodynamic and dynamic environment, and their impacts on the TC circulation. Previous theoretical and numerical studies have suggested that convective heating and associated low-level convergence inside the RMW can efficiently intensify the maximum winds. Outside the RMW, mid-level inflow associated with stratiform precipitation can efficiently spin-up the broader circulation through convergence of absolute angular momentum above the frictional boundary layer. The research will use existing research observations at different stages of the TC lifecycle from intensifying and non-intensifying storms to test these hypotheses. A new variational analysis technique called SAMURAI developed by the Principal Investigator will be used to integrate aircraft and radar observations into three-dimensional thermodynamic and kinematic fields for analysis. High-resolution Cartesian and low-wavenumber cylindrical analyses with improved radar thermodynamic retrievals will be conducted and augmented with numerical simulations to improve our understanding of TC intensification.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This study integrates research and education by developing a new graduate radar meteorology course with a digital, interactive textbook, and incorporating mesoscale TC observations into physical meteorology curricula to train and encourage students to test scientific hypotheses using field observations. The open source SAMURAI analysis software and material from the digital radar meteorology textbook will be available to the atmospheric science community to enhance research and education infrastructure. The University of Hawaii at Manoa represents a demographically and geographically unique state in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, and the Principal Investigator is committed to improving diversity by including women and underrepresented minorities such as Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians in the project. Improvements in our understanding of TC intensity change can have a significant positive impact on society. The application of the findings from continued research on hurricanes and typhoons can ultimately help to improve our forecast ability and reduce life and property loss throughout the globe.","10/24/2016","10/24/2016","1701225","Michael","Bell","mmbell@hawaii.edu","10/24/2016","Principal Investigator","Colorado State University","Fort Collins","805232002","9704916355","601 S Howes St","United States","Colorado","CO","1525","PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The new technology will successfully combine electronic and photonic systems creating previously unimagined functionality and performance. Such sophisticated electronic-photonic systems-on-chip with highly-efficient use of area, energy and spectral resources are critically needed in many communication scenarios. For example, current data-centers and high-performance supercomputers are both power-constrained. High-bandwidth density and high-energy efficiency photonic interconnects would allow the connectivity down to the processor chip level increasing the power-efficiency and utilization of the whole data-center, significantly impacting the national energy consumption in the next decade. However, the lack of large-scale integration approach, design methodology and unified cross-layer design has prevented the realization of these systems. The impact of the electronic-photonic designs and system design methodology proposed in this project spans not only communication systems, but also a variety of other sophisticated electronic-photonic systems (e.g. detection, sensing, and instrumentation). The multi-disciplinary work will educate a unique crop of engineers and scientists that cross the boundaries of electronic and photonic systems. <br/><br/>The objective of the research project is to utilize recently developed large-scale electronic-photonic integration approaches to design short-reach coherent-modulation photonic links that significantly improve the area, energy and spectral-efficiency. The proposed electronic-photonic circuit topologies for coherent high-order modulation transmitters and receivers leverage the advantages of each domain and correct for the non-idealities in the other. Starting from the modeling and simulation infrastructure, the proposed research comprises a unique simulation and modeling framework in Verilog-A, which allows for true co-simulation of photonic and electronic circuits, under large signal, non-linear, time-varying conditions. This capability gives vital insights into the interaction of electronic and photonic circuits. It is essential for the use of the resonant components as the second key ingredient in designing efficient electronic-photonic communication systems. Although energy and area efficient, the resonant components require sophisticated wavelength stabilization loops and electronic drive to compensate for their transfer-function characteristics, which are enabled by the co-simulation methodology and abundance of high-performance transistors in the proposed integration approaches.","10/20/2016","10/20/2016","1701596","Milos","Popovic","mpopovic@bu.edu","10/20/2016","Principal Investigator","Trustees of Boston University","BOSTON","022151300","6173534365","881 COMMONWEALTH AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7564","COMMS, CIRCUITS & SENS SYS","096E","High freq comm/sensing circuits",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research finding has been addressed in multiple venues and across multiple areas of law. It has not been tested historically, nor do we know enough about what that means when members of disadvantaged groups take court cases in local courts against people who may only be marginally more advantaged, or may differ in legal status. Yet in multiple jurisdictions, members of minority groups have used the courts to make claims and vindicate interests. Finally, the framework remains underexplored in explicit comparisons across types of legal regimes. This project will test the significance of both legal status and jurisdiction in making claims in the courts, comparing across common-law and civil-law regimes. Civil law jurisdictions organize legal claims making differently from common law systems. People who took cases to court varied by legal status. That variation will allow the project to evaluate the significance of legal status in making legal claims, both in process and outcomes. Litigation indicates that the legal system was not solely the province of the elite.

Such functions typically involve significant changes to the shapes of the molecules. Computer simulation methodology for studying such molecular motions will be developed in the current project. The new methodology will combine advances in software and hardware. For example, new software is being developed to exploit the 99.9% of computer memory that goes unused in typical current simulations. The importance of this type of research can be understood in terms of biomolecular timescales: although cutting-edge simulations on special computers today can reach the microsecond scale or even beyond for small systems, it is widely appreciated that key biochemical phenomena occur at timescales of even seconds and longer - that is, one million times longer than computational capacity. Until this computing gap is bridged, it will be extremely difficult to systematically study the full range of biomolecular motions which keep cells working.<br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>Besides research, the proposal targets science pedagogy in two ways.

Accompanying these trends is a growing scarcity of caretakers, care deliverers, and care facilities to attend to our growing elder population. Technology supporting health for older adults tends to be limited to computerized monitoring systems and, potentially someday in the future, as assistive 'humanoid' robots that look and function something like us. Our homes and their many furnishings, meanwhile, remain conventional, low-tech, and maladaptive to life changes. To promote independent living, this research team from architectural design, robotics, and human factors explores how our homes can be outfitted with furnishings of advanced functionality. This project, home+, is a collection of robotic home furnishings that fits easily into any conventional home to increase the quality of life of individuals with impaired mobility and cognitive functioning by enabling routine domestic activities. This research project will: (1) establish the needs and wants of older people wishing to age in place, identifying those aspects of the home+ concept that best promise to support independent living; (2) design robotic furnishings, accordingly; (3) test these furnishing to determine how well they interact with each other and with the people that use them; (4) define the choreography by which these furnishings and their users interact; and (5) evaluate how well home+ supports typical users performing ten routine home tasks that define a capacity for independent living. The team will gain insights not only from the targeted populations and healthcare professions who may benefit most by home+, but also from a wider audience. This outreach aspect of the home+ project will culminate in a workshop that seeks marketplace and practice support for advancing the prototype. <br/><br/>The majority of seniors want to age in place in their homes. To realize this goal, this project will: (1) conduct a needs assessment of older adults; (2) iteratively co-design and usability test robotic furnishings that recognize, communicate with, and partly remember each other in interaction with human users (interoperability); (3) define the pattern language of interactions for this cyber-human system; and (4) evaluate the efficacy of home+ by comparing performance on 10 routine home tasks defining a capacity for independent living for individuals with and without home+. Drawing on research and formalism in distributed robotics, the team will focus efforts on implementing and evaluating three software environments for home+: (1) a centralized architecture, with all sensory information, processing, command and control at a single source; (2) a distributed architecture, with localized sensing, processing, and control, and minimal interactions between elements; and (3), a combination of the first two, with a dedicated interface layer between the high-level strategies of (1) and the reactive behaviors of (2).

Yet, designing effective mechanisms for censorship resistance ultimately depends on accurate models of the capabilities of censors, as well as how those capabilities will likely evolve. In contrast to more established disciplines within security, censorship resistance is relatively nascent, not yet having solid foundations for understanding censor capabilities or evaluating the effectiveness of evasion technologies. Consequently, the censorship resistance tools that researchers develop may ultimately fail to serve the needs of citizens who need them to communicate. Designers of these tools need a principled foundation for reasoning about design choices and tradeoffs. <br/><br/>To provide such a foundation, this project develops a science of censorship resistance: principled approaches to understanding the nature of censorship and the best ways to facilitate desired outcomes. The approach draws upon empirical studies of censorship as the foundation for models and abstractions to allow us to reason about the censorship-resistant technologies from first principles. The project aims to characterize and model censorship activities ranging from blocked search results to interference with international network traffic. The research develops theoretical models of censorship; reconciles these with large-scale empirical measurements; and uses these observations to design censorship-resistance tools to deploy in practice, as both components of Tor and standalone systems.","10/31/2016","10/31/2016","1700657","Phillipa","Gill","phillipa@cs.umass.edu","10/31/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Hadley","010359450","4135450698","Research Administration Building","United States","Massachusetts","MA","8060","Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","7434","CNCI","7925","LARGE PROJECT","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Computer simulations test design parameters much more cheaply than physical experiments. Also, computer simulations participate in a fortuitous cycle with theory by enabling inexpensive experimentation of theoretical models. Mapping computer simulations to high performance computer architectures is a challenging computer science problem; constraints include achieving high performance and effective use of computing resources while not overburdening scientific programmers. This challenge is becoming more severe as architectures continue to evolve in ways that make them ever more difficult to use. In this project, the PIs will remove programmer burden by developing a programming abstraction called loop chaining, which enables architecture-specific program optimizations by compilers. This work enables scientists to spend less time dealing with annoying performance programming details and more time evolving their scientific models that help push science and engineering forward.<br/><br/>Exposing opportunities for parallelization while explicitly managing data locality is the primary challenge to porting and optimizing existing computational science simulation codes. The most popular programming models used in these codes such as MPI (Message Passing Interface) require that programmers explicitly determine the data and computation distribution. This has led to good scaling between compute nodes, but parallelism and locality are needed within a node as well. There are many approaches for implementing shared memory parallelism, but with most of them it is the programmer's responsibility to group computations to improve data locality. This project focuses on the development of the loop chain abstraction to provide compilers with sufficient information to automate the parallelism versus data locality tradeoff. Preliminary results show that using the loop chain abstraction can significantly improve parallel scalability. The intellectual merits are that the loop chain abstraction will enable existing codes to maintain their software modularity while exposing information critical to performance optimizations that improve parallel scalability. Some important contributions of this research are the re-casting of existing program optimizations to use the loop chain abstraction as input and the eventual incorporation of the loop chain abstraction into parallel programming languages. The broader impacts include reducing the burden on scientists developing computational simulations, sharing the developed compiler prototypes as open-source software, and providing tutorials for doing source-to-source loop chain-based tiling transformations in C++ and Fortran code. The testbed for loop chaining will include atmospheric science, materials, and combustion codes, therefore tunable versions of these applications will be released. Additionally, a new course module will be developed, through which students will be trained in computational science and specifically, on how to expose loop chains within simulation software.","10/28/2016","10/28/2016","1700723","Catherine","Olschanowsky","cathie@cs.boisestate.edu","10/28/2016","Principal Investigator","Boise State University","Boise","837250001","2084261574","1910 University Drive","United States","Idaho","ID","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7923","SMALL PROJECT","7943","PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dormancy responses have evolved in many organisms, from plants and microbes to mammals and insects, to achieve synchrony with local seasonal conditions. Organisms are increasingly challenged by new seasonal regimes caused by 1) contemporary climate change, 2) habitat modifications from human development and urbanization, and 3) movement of species into new areas through managed or accidental introductions. Thus, understanding how dormancy responses rapidly evolve and compensate for shifts in seasonality will be a critical component for understanding the persistence and spread of native and invasive species in our rapidly changing world. This research will characterize the mechanisms that allow rapid adaptation to novel seasonality via changes in dormancy in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, a major pest of apples and a textbook example of rapid species formation. Within the last 200 years, R. pomonella has shifted from its native host hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to introduced, domesticated apple (Malus domestica), and in the process has formed new, partially reproductively isolated populations on apples. Seasonal fruiting time differs substantially among plant species in a given region, so adapting to a novel fruit requires adaptation in insect seasonal timing. In R. pomonella, the newly derived apple population has become established on their novel host fruit via evolved differences in timing of the overwintering dormant stage, which results in temporal matching of insect growth and reproduction with earlier seasonal availability of apple compared to hawthorn fruits. Physiological mechanisms that evolve to adjust dormancy timing are poorly understood, and this research will leverage variation among the fly populations to quantify physiological differences in gene and protein expression and differences in the genome that underlie adaptation at key regulatory points across the fly life cycle. Additionally, experiments will address whether common physiological mechanisms underlie adaptation across the three phases of dormancy (dormancy induction, maintenance, and termination) potentially constraining the rate or direction of evolutionary responses to changing seasonality. This fundamental research has implications in numerous contexts from preserving biodiversity to forecasting agricultural production and the spread of invasive species. Beyond identifying important features facilitating rapid responses to seasonal change, the project will also enhance a pre-collegiate education program in evolutionary biology. Host race formation in R. pomonella provides a clear and intuitive example of ecological adaptation and the genesis of new crop pests, making the flies excellent ambassadors for evolution, a subject poorly understood by many students and the general public. The research team previously developed a workshop and outreach program for STEM education to enhance the evolution knowledge of high school teachers and students from Florida and Puerto Rico, providing materials for science curricula. The current grant will expand the high-school teacher training, add freely accessible web-based curricular materials, and most importantly, formally evaluate the impact of the educational program. Survey-based assessments delivered before, during and after the workshop will assess changes in perception of frequently misunderstood concepts in evolutionary biology.","10/31/2016","10/31/2016","1700773","Gregory","Ragland","gragland@ksu.edu","10/31/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Denver","Aurora","800452570","3037240090","MS F428, AMC Bldg 500","United States","Colorado","CO","7657","Integrative Ecologi Physiology","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students in network inference/anti-inference theoretical and experimental activities, and is expected to significantly impact the security design of mission-critical wireless networks.<br/><br/>Network inference is an effective way to infer the information of network statistics and properties from network measurements. Network inference has enabled a wide range of applications, such as network surveillance, management and diagnosis; however, in certain circumstances, such as wireless networks for military applications, it is important to mask this information to prevent the use of inference for malicious intent. To date, strategies for anti-inference in wireless networks have been overlooked and under-explored. The central goal of this effort is to address the current gap in understanding by exploring the fundamental aspects of proactive strategies that will enable a wide range of anti-inference applications. Specific objectives are to (1) develop a theoretical framework to analyze the behaviors of proactive strategies that enhance network dynamics to achieve anti-inference; (2) reveal the fundamental relationship between the impacts and costs of network dynamics based anti-inference strategies; and (3) implement efficient anti-inference design for network applications. To accomplish these objectives, both deception traffic and routing changing strategies will be utilized to induce higher dynamics in the network to make inference inaccurate. In addition, the cost-benefit impact of these strategies will be examined by shifting from optimized to dynamic network design.","11/02/2016","11/02/2016","1701394","Zhuo","Lu","zhuolu@usf.edu","11/02/2016","Principal Investigator","University of South Florida","Tampa","336129446","8139742897","3702 Spectrum Blvd.","United States","Florida","FL","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","8228","CISE Resrch Initiatn Initiatve","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Madsen","NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Materials with strong mechanical response to applied electric field are of great importance for a wide range of applications ranging from actuators for portable cameras to transducers for audio-speakers and sonars. Since discovery of a giant electromechanical response in gadolinium-doped cerium oxides in 2012, this material is considered as a new type of ceramic that generates strain due to a small fraction of their structural units, called electromechanically ""active"". The main challenge towards understanding this mechanism and rational designing new electromechanical materials with the desired response has been the inability to decipher atomic architecture of these units and ""catch them in action"", that is, to take a snapshot of these units while the strain is generated under electric field. In order to fully characterize the structure of active units ""in action"", the investigators are studying thin film doped cerium oxide ceramics under electric field by high energy resolution methods (such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy) and modeling the results by advanced theoretical methods. The project impacts the field of ceramic materials through the development of fundamental understanding and design criteria for this new class of electromechanical materials. The project fosters international ties between Yeshiva University in New York and Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The broader impacts of this project are realized through establishing connections between faculty and students from both institutions, and in engaging underrepresented groups (such as women) in science and engineering disciplines. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Thin films of cerium oxide that have trivalent metal impurities possess intriguing structural, electric and mechanical properties, including ionic conductivity, non-linear elastic effects and strong mechanical stresses in response to the application of electric field. Anatoly Frenkel (SUNY at Stony Brook), his international collaborator Igor Lubomirsky (Weizmann Institute of Science) and their respective groups are working to understand the mechanisms of electrostriction (a particularly large electromechanical response that is quadratic with electric field). The investigators strive to answer such fundamental questions as the effects of impurities on the generation of strain and stress in the lattice. They are applying advanced methods of X-ray absorption spectroscopy with high energy resolution in situ, under applied field, to identify the active species - cations that are located in the distorted units - in order to understand, in detail, the behavior of these units and their role in the electrostriction. Data analysis is being carried out by modeling structural distortions theoretically and comparing their simulated X-ray absorption spectra with experimental ones.

An important and open question is what is their impact on production allocation across countries, industry prices, costs and surplus. A significant challenge in this task is that government subsidies to industries are notoriously difficult to detect. Indeed, partly because WTO agreements prohibit direct and in-kind subsidies other than infrastructure, the existence and magnitude of such subsidies is often unknown.<br/> The proposed research offers two contributions to the effort of assessing the consequences of subsidies. First, it provides a model-based empirical strategy to detect the presence and gauge the magnitude of government subsidies. Second, it quantifies the impact of these subsidies on industrial evolution.<br/> The PI applies this strategy to the world shipbuilding industry, a prototypical example of an industry in which subsidies are believed to play a prominent role. Shipbuilding in the 2000's is a particularly interesting case because a striking reallocation of production took place: in a single year (2006), China doubled its market share from 25% to 50%, leaving Japan, S. Korea and Europe trailing behind. In 2006, China launched a capital subsidization plan; these capital subsidies are known, observed and not prohibited. However, many asserted that China's rapid rise was also driven by government production subsidies, which are not known, unobserved and prohibited; here the PI disentangles the contributing factors (e.g. differentiated products, inherent cost differences, and most importantly, capital and production subsidies).<br/> The proposal will develop and estimate a model of the shipbuilding industry, providing one of the first empirical analysis in industrial organization looking at dynamic agents on both the demand and the supply side. A large number of shipyards offer durable, differentiated ships. Their production decisions are subject to a dynamic feedback because of time to build: shipyards accumulate backlogs, which affect their future ability to accept new ship orders. Production is also subject to an aggregate stochastic cost shock, summarized in the price of steel, a key production input. Every period a large number of identical potential shipowners decide to enter the freight market by buying a new ship from world shipyards. Demand for new ships is driven by demand for international sea transport, which is uncertain and volatile. As ships are long-lived investments for shipowners, demand for new ships is dynamic.<br/> The model primitive of interest is the cost function of potentially subsidized firms. As in many industries, however, costs of production are not observed. The PI?s strategy amounts to estimating costs from demand variation, as is common in empirical industrial organization, but in a framework of dynamic demand and supply. The estimation strategy first uses new and used ship prices to estimate the willingness to pay for a new ship and then inserts it into the dynamic optimization problem of shipbuilders.<br/> The first objective of the empirical analysis is to detect and measure changes in costs that are consistent with subsidies. <br/> The second objective of the empirical analysis it to use the estimated model to quantify the impact of China's subsidies on ship prices, production reallocation across countries, as well as industry costs and shipper surplus. The PI asks the question whether this impact varies by different types of subsidies (capital or production subsidies).","11/02/2016","11/02/2016","1701898","Myrto","Kalouptsidi","myrto@princeton.edu","11/02/2016","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1320","ECONOMICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cephalopods are marine organisms that include squid, octopus, and cuttlefish. They can undergo rapid and adaptive changes in their skin color for sensing, communication, defense, and reproduction purposes enabling them to blend in or stand out in their local environment. The goal is to determine how these animals are capable of such interactive features and identify which proteins and pigments aid in this function. With this fundamental knowledge, PIs aim to design new materials inspired by cephalopods that may undergo similar color-changing responses. An integrative outreach component is a key feature of this award, where the PIs will build educational materials and experiences to prepare students for STEM careers in materials science and engineering. To this end, the PIs will develop a week-long workshop to train up to 10 high school teachers (mix of non-honors, honors, and AP teachers) on how to design, build, and test optical devices and materials inspired by systems in biology.<br/><br/>Technical: <br/>Cephalopods can actively tune their dermal coloration with the support of neurally-controlled, muscle-actuated pigment organs known as chromatophores. It is known that chromatophores contribute to changes in cephalopod coloration through the active expansion and retraction of pigmented granules confined within a cytoelastic sac; however, the composition of the granules and their role in modulating bulk coloration remain largely unknown. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify how the nanostructure and composition of these granules localized within the chromatophore organs impact broad area coloration during adaptive camouflage. The PIs will use a customized extraction protocol to isolate, purify, and identify the proteins and small molecules present in the chromatophores, investigate their interactions and develop a synthetic strategy to recapitulate their ability to absorb and scatter all wavelengths of visible light. Outreach components and teacher workshops will be designed to leverage the knowledge, tools, and connections from this research into educational materials and experiences to prepare high school students for STEM careers and college degrees where they can explore how biology is used to inspire engineered materials.","11/03/2016","11/03/2016","1700720","Leila","Deravi","l.deravi@northeastern.edu","11/03/2016","Principal Investigator","Northeastern University","BOSTON","021155005","6173732508","360 HUNTINGTON AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1491","Cellular & Biochem Engineering","7218","RET SUPPLEMENTS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","7573","BIO-RELATED MATERIALS RESEARCH","8007","BioMaPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1712","7623",NA,NA,"DMR SHORT TERM SUPPORT","BIOMATERIALS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project addresses fundamental questions essential to the advancement of large and complex network analytics. These challenges are driven by real-world applications in social, biological, and medical domains. The research plan is complemented by a comprehensive education and outreach plan focussed on three elements: (1) the development of new interdisciplinary courses; (2) direct undergraduate involvement in the research projects; and (3) outreach activities including the STEM program targeting K-12 schools. Underrepresented students will be encouraged to participate in this project. <br/><br/>The research goal of the project is to significantly extend the reliability and efficiency of large network analysis. The project has three research aims. (1) Develop novel memory-based random walk proximity measures that can effectively capture the similarity between nodes. Proximity measure is of fundamental importance for many advanced network analysis tasks. A rigorous theoretical foundation will be provided for the developed measures. (2) Study the dual-network model and its applications. The dual-network model has a wide range real-world applications. The specific problem of cross-network node set query will be investigated in the project. Both numerical and algorithmic approaches will be explored.

They can can be covalently attached to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids), or exist as small, soluble molecules. Experimental techniques for studying glycans are not as well developed as for other types of biomolecules, including a lack of computational tools. This means it can be hard to decide which glycans contribute to protein function, how they act to modulate this function, and how to modify them to optimize interesting properties. Structural records of proteins, including glycosylated proteins, are appearing in ever larger numbers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). By selecting these glycosylated protein structures for deeper investigation with sophisticated computational tools, a knowledge-based approach to understanding the relationship between their structure, function and biological roles can be built. Knowledge based approaches allow both top-down understanding of biological roles, and bottom-up simulations of structural fluctuations at the atomic level; the latter provide very deep insight into how different glycans affect the folding and function of modified proteins. In addition, most proteins in cell membranes are glycosylated, which is important to cell recognition and signaling; more realistic modeling of biological membranes, provided by the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder toolset, will further enrich the available repertoire of membrane structure simulations. This project aims to achieve these goals by developing a comprehensive toolset for glycan modeling and simulation. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary computational structural glycobiology. In particular, this project will raise the scientific literacy of the research community through the publication of research results and workshop participation. <br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a computational toolset for modeling and simulation of glycan-containing biological systems and to acquire an in-depth and molecular-level understanding of glycan structure, dynamics, and function in the context of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and protein-glycan complexes. A comprehensive toolset for the computational analysis, modeling, and simulation of glycoconjugates and glycan-associated complexes will be developed. This tool set will include (1) Glycan Modeler, a tool for structure prediction of protein-linked glycans from their primary sequences; (2) GLYSUM, the GLYcan monosaccharide SUbstitution Matrix, the glycan equivalent to the BLOSUM matrix; (3) GLDB, Glycan Ligand Database for easy retrieval of protein-glycan interaction patterns and motifs in the PDB; (4) GBS-Predictor, a template-based tool to predict potential glycan binding sites (GBS) in a target protein; and (5) glycolipid-containing Membrane Builder, an intuitive tool to build a complex membrane system containing glycolipids.

This is achieved by the creation of a curriculum that accommodates students of different levels of computer literacy, that focuses on experiential learning, and that utilizes institutional collaboration via cloud computing. This project will mitigate the challenges small institutions currently face in the cybersecurity area, for example, a tight computer science curriculum and the inability to support the expensive infrastructure required for cybersecurity education. Integrated into this project is research as to whether using this new curriculum and the related online projects, students will attain the same, or an increase, level of cybersecurity learning. <br/><br/>This project will address the above challenges by creating a range of cybersecurity learning opportunities that emphasize hands-on and realistic experimentation for students in small institutions. First, this project will attract a diverse population of students by introducing cybersecurity topics through multiple paths of study and engagement. Students will be introduced to cybersecurity concepts through manageable, stand alone course modules and laboratory exercises. Interested students can study further by taking two cybersecurity focused courses and cybersecurity capstone projects created by this project. Using all these materials students can create a cybersecurity concentration. Second, the project will use the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) infrastructure in the development of empirical labs and the capstone project assignments. GENI offers an affordable cloud solution to small institutions that lack the infrastructure to support sophisticated computer labs. The learning impact of the new curriculum will be evaluated by quantitative competency assessments that are administered yearly. Student cybersecurity persistence will be assessed by a longitudinal study of the number of cybersecurity courses taken during a student's course of study. Qualitative assessment of the curriculum will take the form of student interviews and focus groups to gauge attitude towards course modules, perception of learning gains and comfort level with the pedagogies employed. In addition to the collaboration of three college level institutions, this project will leverage relationships with local community colleges to further develop a cybersecurity workforce. This partnership provides a diverse set of students that will support the evidence-based evaluation of student cybersecurity learning via this approach.","11/04/2016","11/04/2016","1700254","Xenia","Mountrouidou","xenia.mountrouidou@gmail.com","11/04/2016","Principal Investigator","College of Charleston","CHARLESTON","294240001","8439534973","66 GEORGE ST","United States","South Carolina","SC","1998","IUSE","8209","Improv Undergrad STEM Ed(IUSE)","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In many real-world applications, the primary goal of monitoring these observations is to better estimate the time for a particular event of interest to occur. Examples of these events include disease recurrence in healthcare, time to default in finance, device failure in engineering, etc. A major challenge with such time-to-event data is that it is often incomplete; some data instances are either removed or become unobservable over a period of time before the event occurs. Due to this missing piece of information, standard statistical and machine learning tools cannot readily be applied to analyze such data. Survival analysis methods, primarily developed by the statistics community, aim to model time-to-event data and are usually more effective compared to the standard prediction algorithms as they directly model the probability of occurrence of an event in contrast to assigning a nominal label to the data instance. More importantly, they can implicitly handle missing data. However, in many practical scenarios, the missing data challenges are compounded by several other related complexities such as the presence of correlations within the data, temporal dependencies across multiple instances (collected over a period of time), lack of available information from a single source, and difficulty in acquiring sufficient event data in a reasonable amount of time. Such data poses unique challenges to the field of predictive analytics and thus creates opportunities to develop new algorithms to tackle these issues. This project provides innovative computational methods to assist novel scientific discoveries and bring practical transformational impact to the analysis and exploration of various time-to-event datasets and applications. The proposed methods are primarily being evaluated in the context of biomedical data, but are applicable to various other forms of time-to-event data that is often seen in other disciplines such as social science, engineering, finance, and economics.<br/><br/>This project builds novel computational and analytical algorithms that can efficiently and accurately capture the underlying predictive patterns in time-to-event data. The project aims at building new algorithms for longitudinal data analysis, integrate multiple sources while building time-to-event models, and predict temporal events with limited amount of training data. Specifically, the research objectives are to develop the following: (i) Latent feature models that can capture the longitudinal dependencies underlying multiple outcomes over a period of time. Multiple independent regression models for various missing data time windows are learned and then unified into a multi-output regression model over the diverse output space using sparsity regularizers. (ii) Multi-source time-to-event models that can effectively integrate multiple sources of information and make predictions by incorporating prior knowledge about the instances and their relationships. (iii) Bayesian methods for early-stage event prediction to tackle the problem of lack of sufficient training data on events at early stages of studies (which is a common problem in such time-to-event data). All the methods proposed in this project are evaluated using real-world biomedical data including high-dimensional genomic data and heterogeneous electronic health records. In addition, the algorithms developed in this project will also be used to tackle the problem of student retention.","11/07/2016","11/07/2016","1707498","Chandan","Reddy","reddy@cs.vt.edu","11/07/2016","Principal Investigator","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","BLACKSBURG","240610001","5402315281","Sponsored Programs 0170","United States","Virginia","VA","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","7923","SMALL PROJECT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elekonich","The collective behavior of societies emerges from self-organized interactions among group members. Traditionally, group members have been thought of as identical individuals, but behavioral variation is prevalent in nature. This variation can be extreme and one group member, referred to here as the keystone individual, may have a greater impact on the collective behavior of a group than all other individuals. For example, some individuals may lead a group, tutor others or function as super-spreaders of information or disease. Despite the potential impact of keystone individuals on the success of a group, little is known about how and why this influence emerges. The investigators will use social spiders that can be easily manipulated and observed at the individual and group levels to test hypotheses about the emergence of collective behavior, hypotheses that cannot be easily evaluated in more complex systems. In addition to the numerous undergraduate and graduate research projects this project will generate, the proposed work will also be translated into hands-on activities about collective behavior geared towards the education of K-12 students though established and successful outreach programs. Adult science education activities to enhance public knowledge of invertebrate biology will include public lectures, media coverage, and conversations at local communities where the field work occurs.<br/><br/>This research aims to examine the mechanisms by which keystone individuals affect collective behavior, the effects of keystones on the development of collective behaviors and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the presence of keystone individuals in groups. Using a model system that allows for detailed experimental manipulations, the social spider (Stegodyphus dumicola), will allow the investigators to develop a broad theory to enhance the progress of science on keystone individuals. Specifically, this work will (1) test whether keystone individuals produce tradeoffs among colony-level processes such as prey capture and disease spread, and how these tradeoffs change colony performance in different environments; (2) uncover the temporal dynamics of the effects of keystone individuals on the development of collective behaviors in the field; (3) elucidate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie the catalytic effects of keystone individuals on the behavior of other group members and collective outcomes; and (4) design versatile agent-based models that will uncover the general mechanisms by which keystone individuals influence collective behaviors. The investigators will address these questions by combining lab and field experiments, analyzed with sophisticated image analysis technology and social network theory, with computational modeling.

Applications typically require that the nanomaterials be suspended in liquids or immobilized on planar substrates such as glass or silicon. While substrate-based nanostructure synthesis techniques have undeniably given rise to an impressive list of technologically relevant nanomaterials, the scope and scale of this success is dwarfed by the many accomplishments of liquid-based syntheses. With financial support from both the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials program in the Division of Materials Research, the research project aims to remedy this disparity through a new synthetic strategy reliant on forming nanostructures on substrates while immersed in a liquid medium. If proven successful, the approach will allow the solution-based chemistry which has proved so successful to be practiced directly on substrates and, in doing so, establish the science needed to support applications in sensing, photovoltaics and catalysis. Research activities are being integrated with undergraduate education through the supervision of summer undergraduate research internships. Outreach initiatives are being directed toward the matriculation of women into the Engineering profession.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This research project seeks to determine whether synthetic protocols reliant on seed-mediated colloidal chemistry are adaptable to a substrate-based platform reliant on substrate-immobilized templates. The overriding goal is to define the chemical controls and mechanistic framework needed to form organized surfaces of noble metal nanostructures and then establish their technological relevance by demonstrating the functionalities of the plasmonic and chemically active surfaces formed. Three thrust areas advancing additive, subtractive and multistage template-assisted growth modes, which are reliant on heterogeneous nucleation and/or galvanic replacement processes, are being used to isolate the exact roles played by the substrate, reaction kinetics, pH, template material and template surface modifications in determining the reaction product. Being targeted are synthetic protocols able to define periodic arrays of: (i) core-shell structures with advanced functionalities derived from the integration of materials with dissimilar physical and chemical properties into a single nanostructure architecture, (ii) caged nanostructures offering intense plasmonic near-fields and tunable spacings between the nanostructure and its cage and (iii) substrate-based nanoframes written into patterns with predetermined layouts. These synthetic trials, combined with simulations and the use of characterization techniques which are unique to the substrate-based platform, are providing the means to form intricate nanostructures whose shape and composition are engineered to realize a desired response.","11/07/2016","11/07/2016","1707593","Svetlana","Neretina","sneretina@nd.edu","11/07/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Notre Dame","NOTRE DAME","465565708","5746317432","940 Grace Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","1775","ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8990","Optics and Photonics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1762",NA,NA,NA,"SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decades of research and development have transformed SR measures into a critical component of a wide swath of intelligent technologies in areas ranging from information retrieval to human-computer interaction to spatial computing. However, despite the importance and ubiquity of SR, researchers have only recently begun to examine it from a human-centered perspective. These human-centered studies have problematized key assumptions underlying the entire SR literature, e.g. that people from all cultural contexts agree on a single relatedness value between any two concepts. This project addresses long-overdue open questions in the SR literature that will move the field towards a more human-centered approach to SR. To do so, this research will collect datasets of relatedness judgments, mine patterns in Wikipedia and other content, perform statistical analyses, create and evaluate algorithms, develop software, and conduct large-scale user studies.<br/><br/>First, this research will complete four threads of work that redefine semantic relatedness to address human-centered concerns raised in the SR literature: (1) investigate the role of culture in SR and use these results to redefine SR to incorporate cultural context, (2) study SR among the low-notability concepts that are critical to end users but entirely ignored by the SR literature, (3) address the need for SR measures that explain their relatedness estimates to users, and (4) develop more robust human-centered SR evaluation procedures and support their adoption through easy-to-use software. Second, this research will develop new conceptual representations for SR measures that accommodate differing cultural perspectives and create compact contextual SR models that empower applications with tractable human-centered SR algorithms. Finally, the research will demonstrate the power of human-centered SR approaches through their application in improved recommender systems, enhanced Wikipedia reader experiences, and novel information discovery tools.","11/07/2016","11/07/2016","1707319","Brent","Hecht","bhecht@northwestern.edu","11/07/2016","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7923","SMALL PROJECT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Leland","This project in developmental neuroscience examines the influence parents and peers exert on adolescents' willingness to engage in risky behavior at the neural circuitry level. Adolescent risk seeking behavior presents health and safety risks. This research has to potential to contribute significantly to national health and welfare by informing the design of effective interventions with youth at risk for emotional, behavioral, or social difficulties. This project has the potential to challenge and shift current research, update models of adolescent brain development, and ultimately inform the design of early interventions to prevent the rise in adolescent risk taking.<br/><br/>Risk taking underlies many behavioral and health problems that contribute to the public health burden during the adolescent period, such as substance use and externalizing behavior. Emerging evidence from developmental neuroscience suggests that risk taking behavior increases during adolescence partly due to changes in the brain's neural circuitry. Despite these advances, there currently is little understanding of how neurobiological development interacts with social processes during the adolescent period. This is an important limitation given that adolescence is a period marked by increasingly complex social development, and adolescent decision making most often occurs under conditions of socio-emotional arousal. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Telzer will measure how family and peers differentially impact the neurobiology of adolescent risk taking. Adolescents will be scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they engage in a risk taking task and cognitive control task alone, in the presence of a peer, and in the presence of their parent. Adolescents will be followed for one year to measure self-reported risk taking behaviors in order to examine whether social influence on neuro-cognition predicts longitudinal changes in real-world risk taking. Although self-reported intentions predict some variability in future risk taking behavior, self-reports are not sufficient to capture the multidimensional nature of risk taking, particularly among adolescents. The ability to prospectively predict future engagement in risk taking based on adolescents' current neural sensitivity can have profound effects on our ability to develop early prevention programs.","11/08/2016","11/08/2016","1712787","Eva","Telzer","ehtelzer@unc.edu","11/08/2016","Principal Investigator","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","CHAPEL HILL","275991350","9199663411","104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200","United States","North Carolina","NC","1321","DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1698",NA,NA,NA,"DS - Developmental Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, this study investigates the interaction of sulfur-rich magmas coming from the mantle that mix with more evolved magmas that are typically stored for extended times in magma chambers below the volcanic edifice and have relatively low sulfur concentrations. Understanding the behavior of sulfur during such mixing should significantly improve our ability to forecast volcanic behavior. In the atmosphere, volcanic-released sulfur (often during magma mixing) modulates climate and leads to acid rain in humid volcanic regions. Furthermore, sulfur mobility during magma mixing is thought to facilitate metal transport from silicate melt to magmatic aqueous fluids that are responsible for the evolution of societally important magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits. <br/><br/>A quantitative understanding of how sulfur is mobilized and how it facilitates mass transport during magma mixing of andesite and dacite magma remains unexplored experimentally. As magmas hybridize during diffusive re-equilibration, sulfur-bearing phase stability is investigated as a function of time and oxidation state. Given differential diffusivities of different components in diffusion-couple experiments, diffusive gradients lead to transient local environments, in which sulfides and/or sulfates may in one spot be precipitated while in another area they may be dissolved. This drives complex mass transfer between the mafic and felsic magma. Reduced and oxidized conditions will allow the team to assess the role of sulfur oxidation state on these processes.","11/08/2016","11/08/2016","1707615","Philipp","Ruprecht","pruprecht@unr.edu","11/08/2016","Principal Investigator","Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno","Reno","895570001","7757844040","1664 North Virginia Street","United States","Nevada","NV","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Papitashvili","Stratospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas that also protects the planet's surface from destructive solar ultraviolet radiation. Depletion of the ozone layer occurs through a series of chemical reactions in which ozone molecules are destroyed by reacting with halogens (chlorine, bromine, etc.) with some of the halogens originating from man-made halocarbons. These reactions are enhanced with cold temperatures at stratospheric altitudes. Current computer models are capable estimating the magnitude of ozone hole development in the stratosphere over the polar regions, but the models underestimate the amount of stratospheric cooling as compared to measurements made by ground-based remote-sensing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) instruments. This project seeks to better understand the role of atmospheric gravity waves in the Earth's stratosphere and their potential effects on the Antarctic ozone layer. Accurate forecasts of the Antarctic ozone hole parameters by coupling atmospheric chemistry and climate models are critical for monitoring ozone hole recovery. This, in turn, is important for understanding whether or not the goals of the Montreal protocol are being met.<br/><br/>The high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used to account for effects of atmospheric gravity waves that propagate upward in the lower atmosphere and, therefore, affect atmospheric circulation, stratospheric temperature, and consequently behavior of the Antarctic ozone layer. A number of Antarctic ground-based lidar data (from McMurdo, South Pole, Davis, Syowa stations, and past observations at Rothera Station) will be used to validate and examine the WRF modeling results. The enhanced gravity wave parameterization will be used to run ""The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model"" (WACCM) to study the stratospheric circulation and temperatures above Antarctica. This research effort is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of lower atmosphere dynamics and improve or correct parameterization of gravity waves and, thereby, improve models of the lower atmosphere. In turn this will improve understanding of how lower atmosphere processes can affect ozone depletion reactions.

The future melting of ice along the West Antarctic Peninsula is of importance to the regional freshwater budget, ocean circulation, and ecosystems in this biologically active region.

This collaborative project is cofunded by the Nano-Biosensing program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. Bacterial flagella are helical self-assembled structures composed of flagellin subunits. Polymorphic transformations, a key property of flagella, depend on external stimuli including temperature, ionic strength, pH, optical forcing, and possibly by concentration of specific ligands. But the specific levels of stimuli needed to induce transformations have not been well-determined. The goal of the proposed work is to create a flagellar forest consisting of an array of flagella tethered to a substrate. In response to external stimuli, flagellar polymorphic transformations coupled to collective flagellar dynamics will enable the flagellar forest to sense and actuate autonomously in response to the environment. To accomplish the goal, the researchers will: (1) create flagellar forests by gathering filaments into ordered arrays tethered to magnetic motors on a substrate which are actuated by an external rotating magnetic field en masse; (2) characterize the response of individual flagella to thermal, chemical, mechanical, and optical environmental stimuli; and (3) understand how individual flagella interact to create the collective response of the flagellar forest biomaterial. The broader scientific impact of this collaborative project is in developing an understanding how macroscale autonomic behavior in biological systems that is controlled by charge and mass transport at the nanoscale, which, in turn, is controlled by the dynamic response of a vast array of polymeric biomolecules. The educational goal of this project is to effectively communicate cutting-edge research to younger and broader audiences and inspire them toward the goal of obtaining a degree in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The use of biological nanomaterials in an engineered system presents a critical step toward understanding how the biological world has evolved at the nanoscale, as well as how scientists and engineers can improve upon nature using modern assembly and synthesis techniques. The design of ""smart"" systems can take advantage of materials which can respond autonomously to changes in their surroundings. In addition, the work includes an extensive training component for graduate and undergraduate students, preparing them for careers in academia and industry with a comprehensive background in biology and engineering. Throughout the project, the PIs will continue to recruit and mentor underrepresented groups to work in STEM fields. The research will be communicated to the public through strong outreach efforts.

When preserved in the sedimentary record, these layers often serve as important stratigraphic marker beds that can be correlated spatially and temporally and related to the magnitude, source, and timing of eruptive activity. Sedimentological analysis of these deposits enable investigation of fundamental geologic questions related to arc generation, maintenance, and destruction processes. These include: (1) the rates, timing, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, 2) identification of systematic patterns or variance in the time series of volcanic eruptions in terms of eruptive style, eruption magnitude, and repose periods, (3) assessing the completeness of the onshore record, especially if the marine record contains events not archived onshore, and (4) the nature of volcanism during the construction of a volcanic complex (magma evolution, production rate, eruptive styles, spatio-temporal distribution of eruptive vents and products, and importance of constructional vs. destructional processes). This information is essential to inform assessments of present-day hazards from active arc volcanoes. However, while constraining the long term eruptive history of a volcanic arc before the start of written historical records or beyond well-preserved subaerial tephra fall deposits (often representing only a few thousand years) is important, it is inherently difficult. <br/><br/>Key to establishing an accurate geologic record is the development of a methodology capable of accurate, replicable, quantitative, and routine identification of these tephra layers in marine sediment sequences. Traditionally, tephrochronologic methods have been applied to visible tephra beds that are typically characterized by discrete, often dark-colored depositional layers. This limits tephrochronology studies to areas proximal to volcanic sources capable of producing voluminous deposits. Cryptotephras, fine layers of ash that may not be visible to the naked eye, may either represent smaller eruptions or eruptions from more distal sources. Identification of cryptotephra has now become essential in order to fully constrain the eruptive history of a volcanic center. Previously cryptotephra have been identified by a variety of time-intensive and destructive methods. The goal of this proposal is to document and characterize different sedimentary properties and semi-quantitatively identify the distribution and magnitude of cryptotephras in the sediment record at millimeter scale resolution from the surrounding sedimentary matrix using high resolution continuous scanning techniques. These techniques include: (1) magnetic measurements, particularly magnetic susceptibility; (2) reflectance spectroscopy; (3) core XRF scanning using the ITRAX system; and (4) Computer Tomography (CT) scans. While these four techniques have demonstrated their potential for the identification of tephra, they have rarely been used together, especially at the resolution required to document cryptotephra. Combining these three methodologies will provide a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic, and spectral properties of sediment, all of which have independently been shown to vary substantially with the presence of tephra and also allow evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques for cryptotephra identification. The described techniques will be applied to IODP cores drilled off Montserrat to establish a long term tephrochronologic record of Montserrat and to better constrain the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc. This research will generate: (1) an expanded geologic history of the volcanic system driving Montserrat and an associated hazard assessment; (2) a better understanding of the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc; and (3) an evaluation of a set of techniques that can be used to rapidly identify cryptotephra layers in sediment sequences by non-destructive means.","11/08/2016","11/08/2016","1709889","Molly","McCanta","mmccanta@utk.edu","11/08/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Zanzerkia","The proposed work addresses a challenge central to the EarthCube program's success: How to employ state of the art technology for geoscience data discovery, access, and integration. The project brings together significant geosciences holdings in the ocean, earth and polar sciences to demonstrate how innovative technologies can be robustly applied to these facilities to enhance the capabilities for scientists to discover and interpret relevant geoscience data and knowledge. The end product, GEOLink, will lower barriers to cross-repository data discovery and access, while respecting and preserving repository autonomy and heterogeneity. They will demonstrate the approach through a portal that allows searching and browsing of integrated content from multiple repositories.<br/><br/>A key challenge for EarthCube is to enable data discovery, access, and integration in a sustainable way. Existing data repositories and networks must be linked, while retaining their independent missions and services to existing disciplinary communities. Cultural, conceptual, and infrastructural heterogeneities must be respected in order to maintain different perspectives and differing priorities and thus foster inclusivity in the EarthCube endeavor. In particular, individual choices made by providers of data or repositories will need to be respected in an inclusive manner, and approaches to integration must reflect this. At the same time, however, the diversity and heterogeneity of geoscience data presents a significant barrier to its discovery. In this project, the researchers involved will develop a demonstration called GEOLink based on: 1) digital publication of geoscience data and knowledge as ""Linked Open Data""; combined with 2) semantic integration using design patterns and vocabularies shared among federated repositories; and 3) an underlying cyberinfrastructure extendable in both depth and breadth, that can become a central building block for EarthCube data harmonization. The cyberinfrastructure underlying the approach is extendable, sustainable, and affordable - leveraging state of the art developments in Linked Open Data and formal semantics, grounded through shared Ontology Design Patterns. GEOLink-enabled repositories will support discovery of related resources, including Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R), the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office (BCO-DMO), Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA), the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), DataONE, and the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), as well content from other EarthCube Building Block projects and collaborators.","11/09/2016","11/09/2016","1704896","Thomas","Narock","tnarock@ndm.edu","11/09/2016","Principal Investigator","College of Notre Dame of Maryland","Baltimore","212102404","4105325314","4701 North Charles Street","United States","Maryland","MD","8074","EarthCube","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The biggest everyday challenge for visually impaired individuals is safe and quick navigation to reach a desired destination in unfamiliar outdoor/indoor environments. Outdoor navigation for unsighted people can be greatly facilitated by GPS-based aids which unfortunately do not work in indoor environments lack of GPS signals. This proposal outlines a challenging research plan on developing, prototyping, and evaluating a secure and usable indoor navigation system for the visually impaired. The scientific promise of the proposed research will expand the fundamental understandings about indoor navigation for the visually impaired with the potential to open a new research direction. Successful development and implementations of the proposed techniques will have profound impact on allowing visually impaired individuals to have indoor navigation and wayfinding as sighted people, thus significantly improving the mobility and wellbeing of millions of visually impaired users in the US and around the world. <br/><br/>The proposed research consists of six main research thrusts. The first thrust is to investigate novel crowdsourcing-based techniques to construct accurate indoor floor plans for arbitrary indoor venues with or without large open spaces. The second thrust is to develop secure cooperative techniques to detect and minimize the impact of fake mobility traces submitted by dishonest crowdsourcing workers. The third thrust is to investigate crowdsourcing-based construction of an indoor image database that can well characterize and visualize an indoor venue. The fourth thrust is to develop crowdsourcing-based techniques to enable accurate point-to-point indoor navigation for the visually impaired. The fifth thrust is to investigate novel techniques that can provide visually impaired individuals enhanced indoor navigation experience similar to what sighted persons can get.

This NSF award exclusively supports the participation costs of junior US-based attendees at the workshop who will benefit from engaging with leading experts. Internationally recognized experts will present recent progress and discuss future directions of algorithmic and mathematical research in the quantification of uncertainties in the outputs of complex systems that are subject to random uncertainties in their inputs. Because such systems are ubiquitous, the workshop will impact the scientific, engineering, social, financial, economic, environmental, and commercial milieus. The structure of the workshop is designed to maximize its short- and long-term impact. The scientific focus of the workshop is on three very promising algorithmic areas for which near-term improvements would have an immediate and lasting impact on all the settings mentioned above. An important feature of the workshop is several discussion sessions at which participants can use the information gathered from the lectures to agree on the best possible research directions for each algorithmic area. To maximize their impact, the results of the discussions will be widely disseminated via a web site and through the publication of articles in professional society news magazines. Finally, the long-term impact of the workshop will be greatly enhanced by having a substantial majority of the participants be junior researchers. The workshop lectures and discussion sessions will greatly help those participants to form cutting-edge, long-term research programs.<br/><br/>The workshop will address complex systems modeled by partial differential equations and probabilistic descriptions of uncertainties. Reductions in the cost while maintaining a desired fidelity for uncertainty quantification for this setting can be realized in two ways: one can reduce the cost of obtaining approximate solutions of the partial differential equation and/or one can reduce the number of times the partial differential equation has to be solved. For the former, the workshop will focus on two approaches. First is the development of more efficient solvers for the large discrete systems that arise from, e.g., finite element discretizations. The second is the development of improved reduced-order models that result in much smaller, and thus much cheaper to solve, discretizations of the partial differential equation. Reductions in the number of times the partial differential equation has to be solved will be addressed through the development of improved methods for approximating the dependence of solutions on the random parameters, especially when a large number of parameters is involved. Recent advances in high-dimensional approximation theory will play a prominent role.","11/14/2016","11/14/2016","1707658","Max","Gunzburger","gunzburg@fsu.edu","11/14/2016","Principal Investigator","Florida State University","TALLAHASSEE","323064166","8506445260","874 Traditions Way, 3rd Floor","United States","Florida","FL","1271","COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marta","D'Elia","mdelia@fsu.edu","11/14/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It finds applications in a plethora of domains, such as security, finance, astronomy, and medicine. Despite its immense popularity, however, it remains an extremely challenging task for many real world applications. For many practitioners, the task is poorly defined and under-specified as existing definitions and solutions are often too simplistic and do not directly correspond to the needs of modern applications. This project takes the essential steps to bridge the gap between research and practice to dramatically improve the usability, effectiveness, and interpretability of anomaly mining techniques, and to ultimately mature the field into a more valuable contributor to the larger world. It promises significant impact on many concrete problems, such as insider threat, tax evasion, and health-care fraud detection, important for the government, industry, and the society. Collaborations with industry and hospital partners aim to shepherd innovations into deployed technology, with tangible impact on security and healthcare.<br/><br/>The primary agenda to achieve these goals involves developing a new framework for anomaly mining that utilizes multiple heterogeneous data sources and techniques in a corroborative fashion to fundamentally reframe our understanding and ability to define, detect, and describe real-world anomalies. The project formalizes novel definitions of complex anomalies that fuse multiple data sources, and invents complex anomaly detection algorithms that further present descriptions that provide rationale for the detected anomalies. Research also explores and models anomaly ensembles that systematically harness evidences from multiple detection techniques. Ultimately, this project strives to push the boundaries of anomaly mining as a field through this quest for principled foundations and practices.","11/14/2016","03/10/2017","1703276","Leman","Akoglu","lakoglu@cs.cmu.edu","11/14/2016","Principal Investigator","Carnegie-Mellon University","PITTSBURGH","152133815","4122689527","5000 Forbes Avenue","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The recent emergence of cloud computing and the need to protect privacy of sensitive data used in outsourced computation serves as another major motivation for this work. With this in mind, this project targets at developing a compiler suitable for privacy-preserving execution of any functionality specified by a user program. Our compiler transforms a program written in an extension of the C programming language, where data to be protected are marked as private, into its secure distributed implementation in C, which can be consecutively compiled into a binary executable by a native compiler. The goal of the project is to preserve all features of the programming language and enable efficient implementation of user programs using a number of optimization techniques. The secure distributed computation is implemented using secure multi-party techniques on secret-shared data and is suitable for secure collaborative computation and secure computation outsourcing.<br/><br/>These techniques will allow for more secure cloud computing, even in the presence of attackers.

These artificial cells can contain living cells and be assembled into tissue for artificial organs, or contain inorganic particles to assemble into micro-scale tools. <br/><br/>MAESTRO will ferry desired components in artificial cells constructed from polysaccharide-based hydrogels. Current approaches use engineered structures or live bacteria as micro-scale actuators to push or pull desired objects into place.

Furthermore, artificial cells can be triggered to efficiently release their payloads. Novel swarm control algorithms using obstacle-based particle computation will steer the cells. In traditional robotics, simultaneous control of multiple robots is based on individual motion control that requires heterogeneity among robots or the ability to deliver multiple input signals; both approaches are currently impractical in small-scale systems. However, these challenges can be overcome by parallel motion planning in obstacle-filled workspaces.

This challenging issue has been addressed over the past few decades with limited success, due in part to the complex and interrelated factors that influence the career advancement of underrepresented minority faculty. Strategies are needed to increase the numbers and career success of underrepresented minority faculty, to ensure diversity in engineering and national competitiveness.<br/><br/>The goals and activities are closely aligned with NSF's mission to broaden the participation and success of underrepresented populations in engineering. Faculty of color represent an alarmingly small, untapped and underserved population in the academic ranks within engineering. This state of affairs informs the goals of the proposed project, which is to enhance the presence, socialization, retention and advancement of junior and mid-career faculty from underrepresented populations in engineering. The project seeks to achieve these goals via the following objectives: 1) development and implementation of a holistic array of career development initiatives for underrepresented early and mid-career faculty; and 2) implementation of research on practices and policies impacting the progression and advancement of these faculty members. The project includes a professional/leadership development component, informed by existing knowledge on the factors that help underrepresented faculty members succeed. There is also a research component that is intended to add to the national knowledge base on issues of career progression. <br/><br/>Key features of the project include: an annual professional/leadership development symposium, the formation of an on-line community (e.g., using the NSF-funded National Institute for Faculty Equity website, webinars, etc.), organized networking at professional society meetings, the active engagement of senior scholars and opportunities for multi-year participation. Additionally, the symposium will be used as a forum to implement a mixed-methods study of the factors influencing underrepresented faculty members' experiences in academia. In this vein, the project will explore the following research questions: <br/><br/>RQ1. What individual and systemic factors are facilitating and/or hindering the progression and advancement of URM faculty members?<br/>RQ2. What are the salient intragroup differences in the experiences of URM faculty? (e.g., How do foreign-born Black faculty members experience the academy differently than their US-born peers? How do the experiences of Hispanic faculty members differ based on their country of origin?)<br/>RQ3. How do URM faculty members' past professional development experiences impact their present day responses to challenges and opportunities?<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the success and advancement of minority faculty in engineering, thereby enhancing their participation and retention, and increasing their ranks. The increased presence of these minorities enhances faculty diversity and provides the role models and self images that contribute to the enhanced recruitment, retention, and ultimate success of all students -- especially those from groups underrepresented in the engineering workforce -- which is necessary to build a diverse science and engineering workforce required to maintain national competitiveness and prosperity.","11/15/2016","11/15/2016","1700047","Stephanie","Adams","sgadams@odu.edu","11/15/2016","Principal Investigator","Old Dominion University Research Foundation","Norfolk","235082561","7576834293","4111 Monarch Way","United States","Virginia","VA","7680","ENG DIVERSITY ACTIVITIES","110E","EDUCATION RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This diversity represents the multi-dimensional nature of social impacts from energy development but demands coordination and integration among social science perspectives. This research network expands the capacity of social scientists to measure and analyze the impacts of energy development in host landscapes and communities through the development of shared conceptual frameworks and metrics. Based at South Dakota State University and supported by Montana State University, the Research Coordination Network (RCN)features a steering committee of leading energy development experts from multiple social science disciplines. Using in-person and virtual forums, the network will support researchers in discussing, evaluating and coordinating social science energy research. The network will deliver a cluster of curricular resources directed at non-expert audiences such as high school and university undergraduate students, local officials, and affected residents. The RCN will provide policy makers, community officials, and energy company officials with an integrated social science approach to understand and mitigate adverse effects of energy development, while specific protocols are identified to encourage participation of diverse and underrepresented populations. A strategic project advisory board drawn from industry and government will help the network consider how research can be more relevant and defensible to decision makers, enabling better informed, more effective energy development planning and policy.<br/><br/>This RCN is driven by the following hypothesis: The measurement and analysis of social impacts can be coordinated across diverse forms of energy development and academic discipline, and doing so will increase the utility of social science and improve societal capacity to address the unprecedented opportunities and challenges of the current energy transformation. The goals of this research network are to 1) foster a diverse cross-disciplinary research community; 2) develop and promote a set of data collection standards, framing concepts, and longitudinal design to allow for comparison of data acquired across energy landscapes; and 3) disseminate syntheses and data and design standards to inform policy dialogues and undergraduate curricula. This project will advance scientific understanding in the following ways: (1) Networked scholars will foster the compatibility of currently disparate social, economic and geographic energy-impact theoretical frameworks through new synthetic, conceptual work. (2) Strategic planning of new data collection and analytical techniques will achieve novel discoveries across multiple settings and fill chronic gaps in social science energy research. (3) Appropriate standardization of research design across regions and disciplines will increase compatibility and comparability of data and results, reducing redundancy and increasing robustness of collected data and reliability of results.","11/15/2016","11/15/2016","1700688","Jeffrey","Jacquet","jacquet.8@osu.edu","11/15/2016","Principal Investigator","Ohio State University","Columbus","432101016","6146888735","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Ohio","OH","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results from this study will not only impact our understanding of the evolution of developmental mechanisms, but also our understanding of the discovery of broader evolutionary trends. Dr. Ruvinsky will incorporate findings of this work into his teaching of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago as well as to science teachers of Chicago Public Schools. Research in Dr. Ruvinsky?s laboratory will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will be trained in experimental and computational approaches central to this proposal. The PI and other members of the laboratory will present their findings at a variety of scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The Ruvinsky Laboratory at the University of Chicago has established the gene unc-47 in Caenorhabditis nematodes as a model system for the study of gene regulatory evolution. Despite an apparently conserved expression pattern among these nematode species, the mechanisms that control unc-47 have diverged. The PI proposes three aims. First, Dr. Ruvinsky will dissect in detail the divergence of cis-regulation of the unc-47 gene in Caenorhabditis. Combining comparative and functional approaches, this work will provide a detailed picture of changes, possibly at the single-nucleotide resolution, that led to the divergence of regulatory mechanisms, while preserving the expression pattern. Second, using both standard and state-of-the-art molecular genetic methods, Dr. Ruvinsky will identify compensatory mutations in trans(cription) factors that permitted cis-regulatory divergence of unc-47 without changes to the expression pattern of the gene. Finally, Dr. Ruvinsky will determine the generality of the principles of regulatory divergence inferred from the unc-47 locus. Several genes have been identified that retain conserved expression in different species, while being regulated in subtly different ways. The goal of this aim is to test whether the rules governing changes in unc-47 regulation apply to other genes. Together these experiments promise to provide a highly detailed mechanistic view of gene regulatory evolution and thus contribute to the study of Evo-Devo.","11/15/2016","11/15/2016","1708518","Ilya","Ruvinsky","ilya.ruvinsky@northwestern.edu","11/15/2016","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1119","ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, these capabilities serve as the foundation for the design and development of novel applications of optical science. This Materials World Network project explores the science behind the interaction of light with exotic material structures having vanishingly small dielectric permittivity, also known as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, that are potentially able to dramatically suppress diffraction of light and to extend the applicability of the quasi-static approximation to wavelength-scale systems. In this project, the researchers will create a novel material platform of ""designer"" ENZ media and will use this platform for building an analytical description of the optics of ENZ-related systems. Specifically, a set of experimental techniques will be developed for subwavelength lateral control of the permittivity profile of our materials, targeting important visible and IR frequency ranges. Optical characterization of these structures will be used to provide the foundation for novel numerical and analytical techniques capable of describing the light-matter interaction in complex ENZ-based media. It is expected that both the experimental and theoretical results of this work will have broader application for plasmonic- and meta- materials across the UV to THz wavelength ranges. The students involved in the project will benefit from the unique exposure to modern interdisciplinary projects combining materials science, chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics, and involving multiple institutions across the globe. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Optical science is increasingly interwoven with many aspects of our everyday life, from optical communications, to imaging, to a broad range of optical sensing technologies in health-, environmental, and security-related applications. New optical materials, with unique, yet designer-enabled, properties, promise to further improve the quality or our life, and perhaps as importantly, provide a better understanding of the fundamental interaction between two building blocks of our Universe, light and matter. In this Materials World Network project, an international team will develop a unique new class of materials, known as epsilon-near-zero materials, and analyze the interaction of these materials with light. This research has the potential to provide a novel material platform for merging optics and electronics technologies, bringing together the benefits of high-speed optical communications with the compactness of integrated circuits. The complementary expertise of the participants will provide a unique opportunity to expose participating students to modern interdisciplinary international collaboration, enhancing multi-discipline and multi-cultural exchange. The interaction between the research teams and the broader community will aim at increasing the participation of emerging scientists in STEM-related disciplines.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.","11/17/2016","11/17/2016","1711849","Daniel","Wasserman","dw@utexas.edu","11/17/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","1775","ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","7488","MATERIALS WORLD NETWORK","9161","SINGLE DIVISION/UNIVERSITY","AMPP","ADVANCED MATERIALS & PROCESSING PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7222",NA,NA,NA,"XC-Crosscutting Activities Pro",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research lies in its contribution to the development of design and control theory for general mechanical systems under various restrictions. First, the cooperative systems under consideration require unidirectional control inputs. Second, the proposed research will also contribute to the fundamental design and control theory for multiple nonholonomic systems under physical constraints. Ultimately, the proposed research also provides fundamental understanding of networked robotic systems that must operate in complex, dynamic, and unstructured environments. There is still relatively little work that treats the physical-interactions and physical power-flows within the broad multi-agent-systems literature, which we seek to remedy.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of this research are in application areas such as cooperative payload transport, technologies to assist first responders at accident scenes, search and rescue applications, and remote scientific studies of many kinds, such as experiments conducted in undersea environments, rain forest environments, or arctic environments.

The workshop builds on a successful workshop on this topic held in 2015. Analog model experiments contribute substantially to the understanding of tectonic processes. In these experiments, weaker materials (sand, clay, etc.) take the place rocks and are deformed at high strain rates under controlled conditions thus producing scale models of the development of earth structures (faults, folds) and large-scale tectonic features (mountain belts, rift systems). The aim of this workshop is to bring together the tectonics analog modeling community to discuss future directions in the field, build collaborations with computer-based modelers, and develop curriculum materials. The workshop participants include experimentalists, computer modelers, students, and instructors who use analog models in their classrooms. The workshop will promote the analog modeling skills of early career researchers, thereby developing the future workforce in tectonics. The workshop will promote the participation of students, early career scientists, and researchers from underrepresented groups in the earth sciences.<br/><br/>The past 10 years have seen a revolution within analog modeling of crustal deformation spurred by systematic rheological testing of analog materials and use of laser and image processing techniques for data analysis leading to a strengthening of the quantitative aspect of analog modeling. The vanguard of this revolution has been in Europe where laboratories have been implementing new approaches that permit greater control on experimental conditions, more accurate scaling of deformation and improved insights into the evolution of deformation and deformation processes. This multi-day workshop gathers leading US and international geoscientists who use analog and numerical modeling to discuss techniques that are revolutionizing experimental modeling, as well as challenges for performing and analyzing scaled experiments. This workshop provides a unique and largely informal opportunity for researchers to share some of their best practices. As a mechanism to foster idea-sharing, a half-day physical experiment followed by a half-day numerical analysis will be performed to encourage the entire group to engage in experimental set-up, trouble shooting, data gathering and analysis and to sensitize each community to the needs of the other.

Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory. Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Abakuse Mbrika of the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, will give a one-hour keynote address. Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session. USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development. Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the symposium is to showcase the mathematical research being conducted by underrepresented graduate students. This is done by structuring the meeting so that speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks focusing on research leading to their graduate theses. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Topics of prior years' presentations include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In addition to the parallel sessions, two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour lectures and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Given the high quality and diversity of talks and participants ""The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) Invited Volume"" was created in 2014. This is a new series aimed specifically at disseminating the research of USTARS participants. The intention of this Invited Volume is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to publish their results in order to further their development as mathematical researchers.

The typical engineering process for CPS reuses existing designs, models, components, and software from one version to the next. For example, in automotive engineering, it is common to reuse significant portions of existing model-year vehicle designs when developing the next model-year vehicle, and such practices are common across CPS industries, from aerospace to biomedical. While reuse drastically enhances efficiency and productivity, it leads to the possibility of introducing unintended mismatches between subcomponents' specifications. For example, a 2011 US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recall of over 1.5 million model-year 2005-2010 vehicles was due to the upgrade of a physical transmission component that was not appropriately addressed in software. A mismatch between cyber and physical specifications may occur when a software or hardware upgrade (in effect, a cyber or physical specification change) is not addressed by an update (in effect, a matching specification change) in the other domain. This research will develop new techniques and software tools to detect automatically if cyber-physical specification mismatches exist, and then mitigate the effects of such mismatches at runtime, with the overall goal to yield more reliable and safer CPS upon which society increasingly depends. The detection and mitigation methods developed will be evaluated in an energy CPS testbed. While the evaluation testbed is in the energy domain, the methods are applicable to other CPS domains such as automotive, aerospace, and biomedical. The educational goals will bridge gaps between computer science and electrical engineering, preparing a diverse set of next-generation CPS engineers by developing education platforms to enhance CPS engineering design and verification skills.<br/><br/>The proposed research is to develop new techniques and tools to automatically identify and mitigate the effects of cyber-physical specification mismatches. There are three major research objectives. The first objective is to identify cyber-physical specification mismatches. To identify mismatches, a detection problem will be formalized using the framework of hybrid input/output automata (HIOA). Offline algorithms will be designed to find candidate specifications from models and implementations using static and dynamic analyses, and then identify candidate mismatches. The second objective is to monitor and assure safe CPS upgrades. As modern CPS designs are complex, it may be infeasible to determine all specifications and mismatches between all subcomponents at design time. Runtime monitoring and verification methods will be developed for inferred specifications to detect mismatches at runtime. When they are identified, a runtime assurance framework building on supervisory control and the Simplex architecture will assure safe CPS runtime operation. The third objective is to evaluate safe CPS upgrades in an example CPS. The results of the other objectives and their ability to ensure safe CPS upgrades will be evaluated in an energy CPS testbed, namely an AC electrical distribution microgrid that interfaces DC-producing renewables like photovoltaics to AC.","11/18/2016","11/18/2016","1713253","Taylor","Johnson","taylor.johnson@gmail.com","11/18/2016","Principal Investigator","Vanderbilt University","Nashville","372350002","6153222631","Sponsored Programs Administratio","United States","Tennessee","TN","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","8228","CISE Resrch Initiatn Initiatve","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On one side, the solution directly empowers small and medium scale manufacturers to advertise unused machine capacity that can be rented out to clients who require small lot production of components. The platform may also provide them the ability to focus their business development efforts to obtaining short term and long term contracts through the broker system. On the other end of the solution, the platform directly impacts system integrators by providing them with a near real-time state of suppliers' performance and technical metrics. The solution architecture also allows enterprise customers to update their supplier databases in near real-time states without manual recurrent processing of supply chain information. The solution intends to make supplier sourcing, vetting and selection to be more efficient. Ultimately, the system intends to cut the time between product conception to production and delivery.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the functions and operations of a manufacturing service selection platform. Real-time streaming data from machines on a factory floor populates a virtual digital twin representation of the physical machine and its corresponding factory model in cyberspace. Utilizing a multi-agent simulation software algorithm, we match design and manufacturing features of a given product to manufacturers who have the capacity and capabilities to meet those requirements. The results of the simulation provide an intelligent decision making tool for original equipment designers to source suppliers who are best suited to meet both business and technical requirements. This digital connectivity of machine assets across job/contract shop factories provides unprecedented visibility into machine capabilities and capacities within the supply chain for real-time decision making in supplier sourcing and selection.","11/18/2016","11/18/2016","1700721","Binil","Starly","bstarly@ncsu.edu","11/18/2016","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marcus","Fulghum","mwfulghu@ncsu.edu","11/18/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent work has been investigating new network architecture and protocols to achieve three important design goals of large data centers, namely, flexibility for incremental growth, scalability for large networks, and high throughput. Unfortunately, existing data center network architectures focus on one or two of the above properties and pay little attention to the others.<br/><br/>This research entails a systematic study of the architecture and design issues of a novel coordinate-based network. The design innovations include (i) a random and dense interconnect of network switches to achieve flexibility, (ii) a novel greedy routing protocol on virtual coordinates to replace address-based routing and achieve forwarding plane scalability, and (iii) extension of the greedy routing protocol for high-throughput multi-path routing.<br/><br/>In addition, the design innovations provide network capabilities to support important data center services, such as key-value operations and multicast. Compared to existing work, the coordinate-based network provides new opportunities to achieve these services without exhausting data plane memory.<br/><br/>The research objectives include the following: (i) design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed network architecture and protocols; (ii) design and implementation of scalable data center services in the proposed network, including key-value operations and multicast; (iii) design of the update and recovery methods to maintain a consistent network; and (iv) development of a unified simulator for data center network protocols and prototyping the proposed network.<br/><br/>The results of this research contribute towards enhancing the performance and scalability of current data center networks, the creation of a novel greedy routing protocol using virtual coordinates, and the education of undergraduate and graduate students on network protocol design. Given the growing importance of big data applications and cloud computing, the proposed research has the potential to influence network operation in academia, industry, business, and government. The results of this research will be incorporated into the undergraduate course Computer Networking and Introduction to Database Systems and graduate courses Advanced Computer Networking and Data Center Networks, Cloud Computing, and Future Internet taught by the PI at the University of Kentucky.

Fisher","Management of today's networks usually requires an army of operators who devote tremendous time and energy. Software-defined networking (SDN) has been shown to be a promising paradigm for simplifying network management. However, management tasks in SDNs require the use of constrained network resources: switch memory and CPU, and the switch-controller network bandwidth. Given these resource constraints, network operators may have to reason about resource usage when initiating network management tasks.<br/><br/>This project seeks to explore the space of resource management for software-defined network management. Specifically, it will examine the design of virtualized resource pools that provide the abstraction of (nearly) infinite resources (memory, CPU and switch), while dynamically adapting to the resource needs of these network management tasks. This approach has the advantage that network operators do not have to reason about resource usage when instantiating network management tasks. The research will yield resource management algorithms, improved resource usage designs, and systems implementations for virtualized resource pools.<br/><br/>Network operators make billion-dollar investments in network infrastructures, but put little thought into visibility and control of these infrastructures. This project can lead to better-managed, more reliable, and more resource-efficient network infrastructures in ISPs, enterprises and clouds. These efforts eventually will have broader societal impact by enabling commercial, social, and scientific advances. The proposal will give underrepresented groups and undergraduates opportunities to participate in research and will likely result in technology transfer to major cloud providers and ISPs.","11/21/2016","03/06/2017","1712674","Minlan","Yu","minlan.yu@yale.edu","11/21/2016","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7923","SMALL PROJECT","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Point of care diagnosis is the time critical solution for the early detection of diseases accomplished by staging effective diagnosis tools near the patient, either at the patient?s bedside or at a physician?s office, to monitor and diagnose the patient?s health and wellness without the costly and time-consuming processes necessary when using centralized laboratories. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a novel optical cavity biosensor using chained differential detection for the purpose of point of care diagnosis. Optical cavity based biosensors are by nature very promising for point of care diagnosis due to their label-free operation, low cost, high sensitivity, and high selectivity. On top of the intrinsic benefits of optical cavity based biosensors, the team introduces (1) a three laser diode system to accomplish multiplexability, (2) a differential detection method to enhance its sensitivity, (3) a chained mechanism to increase the linear dynamic range significantly, and (4) a simple cavity structure which is easy to integrate with a sample handling system such as microfluidics. Successful completion of the proposed research project will result in a promising platform for a point of care biosensor that can be used for early detection of diseases and possibly create a new paradigm of medical diagnosis.<br/><br/>For general public:<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a low cost and highly sensitive device which will test for multiple diseases using a small amount of a biological sample, usually blood. The design is composed of a biosensor with simple two reflecting mirror structure (optical resonance cavity), constructed using well known fabrication processes. The simple design of the device ensures that it will be low cost, thus making it accessible to patients in both developed and developing countries. Since the early detection of diseases is the key to treating them effectively, it is crucial for patients to be tested regularly. This device will enable tests to be conducted by the patient in the home or at a physician?s office, in lieu of extensive and time consuming tests, allowing the patient to regularly monitor for the presence of multiple diseases. Enabling the patient to test his/herself regularly will allow diseases to be discovered early and allow for more effective and less expensive treatments.","11/22/2016","03/08/2017","1706472","Seunghyun","Kim","seunghyun_kim@baylor.edu","11/22/2016","Principal Investigator","Baylor University","Waco","767987360","2547103817","One Bear Place #97360","United States","Texas","TX","7909","NANO-BIOSENSING","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","142E","Multi-sens probes & platforms",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Detailed information can be found at http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/numerik/G2S3/index.html. The topic of this summer school is motivated by the observation that in numerous modern applications throughout business, science and engineering, it is extremely challenging to efficiently and stably acquire, analyze, and process massive amounts of data. Recent mathematical advances have shown that massive data sets, and functions associated with them, can often be represented or accurately approximated by only a small number of relevant features; that is, massive data can be represented by a sparse set of features. The summer school will expose PhD students to recent mathematical and computational techniques used in the area of data sparse approximations, and this project ensures participation of well qualified students from U.S. based institutions.<br/><br/>Techniques from several different mathematical fields have been used and continue to be developed in the context of data sparse representations and approximations. Among them are applied harmonic analysis, approximation theory, convex analysis, frame theory, graph theory, imaging science, inverse problems, probability theory, random matrix theory, reduced order modeling, and tensor analysis. In all applications, the outcome of the modeling, simulation, optimization, or approximation is a linear algebraic problem that encodes the underlying functions, the data, and thus also the resulting sparsity. Together with appropriately chosen regularizations and metrics or norms, a key role in the process is played by the fields of numerical linear algebra and optimization. A solid knowledge of these fields is required for working with, and making further advances in the field of data sparse approximations and algorithms. The school will consist of four courses over the two-week period of the summer school: Two courses in the first week of the school will focus on the theory of sparse representation and approximation as well as tensor methods, and two courses in the second week will deal with sparse numerical linear algebra as well as optimization methods in the sparse context.

It is now generally accepted that novel materials are necessary for critical advances in technologies and whoever discovers novel materials generally controls the science and technology of the future. Transition metal oxides have attracted enormous interest within both the basic and applied science communities. However, for many decades, the overwhelming balance of effort was focused on the 3d-elements (such as iron, copper, etc.) and their compounds; the heavier 4d- and 5d-elements (such as ruthenium, iridium, etc., which constitute two thirds of the d-elements listed in the Periodic Table) and their compounds have been largely ignored until recently. The principal investigator seeks to discover novel materials containing 4d- and/or 5d-elements and understand how they offer wide-ranging opportunities for the discovery of new physics and, ultimately, new device paradigms. This project also provides rigorous training to all students involved, focusing on synthesis and characterization techniques covering a broad spectrum of materials and experimental probes available in the principal investigator's laboratory. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Physics driven by spin-orbit interactions is among the most important topics in contemporary condensed matter physics. Since the spin-orbit interaction is comparable to the on-site Coulomb and other relevant interactions, it creates a unique balance between competing interactions that drive complex behaviors and exotic states not observed in other materials. The project encompasses a systematic effort to elucidate physics of novel phenomena in spin-orbit-coupled and correlated materials and a rigorous search for new materials having exotic ground states. This project focuses on the following areas: (1) Novel phenomena at high pressures and high magnetic fields, (2) Unusual correlations between the insulating gap and magnetic transition in iridates and ruthenates, (3) Exotic metallic and superconducting states in iridates, (4) Mott insulators with ""intermediate-strength"" spin-orbit interaction and other competing energies, and (5) Single-crystal synthesis and search for novel materials. The principal investigator is one of a few key pioneers who have initiated seminal studies on iridates and, before that, ruthenates, and has comprehensive facilities and proven expertise for single-crystal synthesis and wide-ranging studies of structural, transport, magnetic, thermal and dielectric properties as functions of temperature, magnetic field, pressure and doping.","11/22/2016","11/22/2016","1712101","Gang","Cao","gang.cao@colorado.edu","11/22/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","1710","CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1712",NA,NA,NA,"DMR SHORT TERM SUPPORT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hamilton","1150790-Boyer<br/>Urine separation and treatment has the potential to radically transform wastewater management whereby water, nutrients, and energy are recovered and toxic contaminants are sequestered. Despite the potential of urine separation and treatment, it has not been widely implemented because of an absence of engineering strategies that are efficient in contaminant removal, practical to implement, and acceptable to society. Accordingly, the research objective of this project is to generate new knowledge of physicochemical processes in urine to achieve sustainable urine separation, treatment, and resource recovery. The central research hypothesis is that ion exchange is a robust, selective, and scalable process, and as such, can be used as a foundational strategy for urine treatment. The education objective of this project is to generate excitement and better understanding of wastewater management ? a topic that is largely underappreciated by society due to the ?ick? factor. The central education hypotheses are that water conservation and visual iconic symbols can be used to increase appreciation, improve understanding, and facilitate learning of STEM concepts related to wastewater management. The research and education objectives will be accomplished by pursuing four specific aims: (1) identify ion exchange processes in urine that achieve maximum and selective recovery of nutrients; (2) quantify the efficacy of ion exchange removal of pharmaceuticals from urine in terms of both removal efficiency and toxicity; (3) identify the life cycle impacts of treatment strategies used to recover nutrients and remove pharmaceuticals from source-separated urine; and (4) evaluate innovative learning approaches for generating excitement and improving understanding of wastewater management. The approach will be to systematically evaluate the kinetics, thermodynamics, and toxicity of ion exchange processes in urine through laboratory experiments; formulate a mathematical model that couples microscale ion exchange with macroscale reactor engineering; conduct life cycle impact assessment of urine treatment; develop an educational pilot program with the Florida Park Service; work with middle school science teachers; and mentor undergraduates and graduates in research. The proposed research is expected to generate new knowledge of physicochemical processes in urine and identify ion exchange strategies that recover nutrients, decrease toxicity, and lead to a sustainable life cycle. The project will establish a new partnership with the UF Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET). The CPET partnership will promote teaching, training, and learning through undergraduate and graduate students hosting workshops for middle school science teachers who will bring their new knowledge back to their students. The educational activities are expected to impact children, students, and adults thereby generating excitement and new understanding of wastewater management.","11/22/2016","11/22/2016","1713704","Treavor","Boyer","thboyer@asu.edu","11/22/2016","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","7643","ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY","012E","Industrial Ecology","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Welkom","The project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project focuses on food sustainability and security on a global scale. The partnerships built into this project will give the Fellow significant inter-disciplinary training (adding the components of randomized controlled trials and crop modeling) beyond the scope of her current expertise. This is particularly important since her goal is to become a sustainability scientist who combines methods and tools from the natural and social sciences to understand how humans are impacted by and adapt to environmental change. Specifically, the Fellow will participate in an interdisciplinary institutes (Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford, and Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkeley). Also, at Stanford University, the Fellow will gain teaching and mentoring experience.<br/><br/>Climate change is predicted to negatively impact agricultural communities and food security across the globe, with models estimating up to a 40% reduction in the yield of some crops by the end of the century. This is particularly problematic for wheat, which is a major staple crop (providing 20% of daily calories) that is already facing declining yields due to warming temperatures. Previous studies have shown that autonomous adaptation strategies (e.g. increasing irrigation, shifting planting date) are not enough to mitigate the negative impacts of warming, and planned adaptation strategies that introduce heat-tolerant wheat varieties are needed to sustainably bolster yields and food security in the face of climate change. Interdisciplinary research is necessary to (1) identify the most effective ways to introduce these new technologies to vulnerable communities, and (2) assess whether the predicted yield benefits of these crops are realized in the field where farmers may deviate from ideal management practices. This study uses randomized controlled trials from development economics to evaluate introduction strategies, remote sensing to quantify if new heat-tolerant wheat varieties provide yield benefits in the field, and process-based crop models to assess whether these new varieties provide predicted yield benefits in future warming scenarios. Understanding the effectiveness of information transfer is particularly important for heat-tolerant crops because, unlike high-yielding varieties introduced during the Green Revolution, heat-tolerant crops may not provide immediate benefits and only produce higher yields in unseasonably warm years. Thus, the adoption and diffusion of this technology may depend purely on whether farmers trust and receive accurate information about possible future benefits. This study is one of the first to examine the most effective ways to introduce new crops that mitigate against climate variability and future climate risk, which is necessary to sustainably enhance food security in the face of climate change.","11/28/2016","11/28/2016","1708480","Meha","Jain","mehajain@umich.edu","11/28/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","7361","EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE","8232","SEES Fellows","7231","CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8055","8211",NA,NA,"SEES Fellows","CyberSEES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, evidence has begun to emerge that these technologies work better in some types of areas (e.g. urban) than in others (e.g. rural). If successful, this research will lead to a wide variety of benefits for areas currently under-served by location-aware technologies, benefits ranging from algorithms that are more accurate in under-served areas to new employment opportunities that involve performing on-the-ground tasks associated with location-aware technologies. The work will also provide technology designers with new tools and techniques - such as new geographic data structures and strategies for handling geographic data sparsity - that will help them ensure that the location-aware technologies of the future are maximally effective everywhere and for everyone.<br/><br/>This research will focus on two families of location aware-technologies: volunteered geographic information-based technologies and location-aware peer economy technologies.

Papitashvili","The near-Earth environment (Geospace) is mostly controlled by the Earth's magnetic field, which provides the Earth with protection from phenomena of electromagnetic nature, such as solar flares, coronal mass ejection, etc.; some of these events could be very dangerous and affect and even damage satellites, their instrumentation, and their communication with ground centers. However, the Earth's magnetic field has some specific regions where it is exposed to all these impacts from outer space. The polar caps are specific areas around the geomagnetic poles where geomagnetic field lines are open and directly interact with the interplanetary magnetic field (that is an extended magnetic field of the Sun). During strong geomagnetic disturbances, the polar caps increase their size - sometimes dramatically. Monitoring the Earth's polar regions, geomagnetic disturbances, currents that flow over these regions, polar cap boundary dynamics, etc., are important issues of space weather studies. Hundreds of magnetometers observe the Northern hemisphere polar cap and auroral zone on a regular basis. However, the Southern hemisphere has many fewer observatories. Having a large network of magnetometers for monitoring the geomagnetic environment is vital for understanding space weather-related events and their impact on environments, since the number of satellites in Geospace continues to grow very fast.<br/><br/>One of the major problems in developing an observational infrastructure in Antarctica is the enormous difficulty for people to reach the region and to stay there. This factor makes any scientific project extremely expensive. Therefore, the development of Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) that can function autonomously with minimal human interaction and maintenance provides a unique opportunity that can solve the problem. The arrangement of instrumentation produces data with a high potential to provide key advances in the field and that are highly demanded by scientific community. The science questions to be addressed in this research effort are: (1) Is the synoptic fluxgate magnetometer determination of the open-closed magnetic field boundary (OCB) valid; (2) What are impacts of solar wind structures on the OCB morphology; (3) How synoptic structures of GPS scintillations are relevant to OCB dynamics, and (4) Could the Iridium's Short Burst Data system be used to transmit fluxgate magnetometer data at a 1-hour time lag. The research is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of the Geospace domain and provide scientific community with vital observations.","11/28/2016","11/28/2016","1716192","Allan","Weatherwax","weatherwaxa@merrimack.edu","11/28/2016","Principal Investigator","Merrimack College","North Andover","018455806","9788375000","315 Turnpike Street","United States","Massachusetts","MA","017Y","Polar Special Initiatives",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5115",NA,NA,NA,"Antarctic Astrophys&Geosp Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studying closely related languages can tell us important details of the nature of human language, by holding most grammatical properties constant while varying others, across a set of languages. Understanding the limits on such variation?and how such differences arise historically?requires an accurate description of a group of related languages. <br/><br/>The heterogeneous varieties of Luyia, a group of Bantu languages of Kenya and Uganda, provide a laboratory for investigating such micro-variation in grammar. This project will produce the first comprehensive descriptions and formal analyses of four underdocumented Kenyan varieties of Luyia: Bukusu, Logoori, Tiriki, and Wanga. A series of monographs will be developed for each language which include a grammatical outline, a detailed description of the tonal system, in-depth studies in syntax, a collection of texts, and a dictionary. <br/><br/>The diverse tone systems of Luyia are a major focus of this work. Luyia tone has many notable features, including a rare process by which High tones spread leftward across and within words. Complex tonal patterns mark inflectional differences among verb tenses, and syntactically conditioned rules are also found in the phrasal tonology. A solid understanding of these processes bears crucially on theories of the phonology-syntax interface, which are concerned with what kind of syntactic information can be used by a phonological system. These theoretically and typologically interesting features of Luyia tone will be systematically investigated through targeted paradigmatic elicitation. <br/><br/>This project models team-based, data-rich and theoretically informed linguistic description and analysis. The Luyia team draws on the expertise of linguists in multiple subfields and brings together US-based and Africa-based scholars, enriching the practice of linguistics by each group.

This project aims to explore the late-stage changes in temperature, pressure, water content, and composition of arc magmas on the ""crystal cargo"" they carry, by testing the premise that the textures and compositions of erupted materials preserve this chronology. Comparison of experimental and natural samples will shed light on magma chamber and transit processes occurring between magma mixing and eruption.<br/><br/>Two historical eruptions of Volcan Quizapu (Chilean Andes), one effusive and one explosive, have been characterized petrologically and geochemically in prior studies. Evidence points to a magmatic system of predominantly dacite with single-episode, eruption-triggering influxes of andesitic magma. The relative simplicity of these interactions makes Quizapu an ideal starting point for a targeted experimental study addressing questions related to magma mixing and ascent/eruption. Key lines of inquiry include constraining resorption/de-stabilization kinetics of plagioclase and amphibole in response to perturbation, as these minerals preserve evidence of magma storage conditions prior to eruption. The goals of this investigation are to (1) establish pre-eruption environmental conditions of Quizapu dacite and andesite, (2) examine response times of key thermobarometers and hygrometers through a series of step-heating experiments, (3) explore the formation conditions of sieve-textured plagioclase, and (4) broadly examine crystal-scale responses to thermodynamic perturbations through high-resolution chemical analysis and diffusion modeling. The results will have general implications for magma mixing processes among intermediate-composition arc magmas, not only because the recharge-triggered Quizapu events are typical of arc volcanoes, but also because the crystal-scale processes on which the study focuses (the influence of halogens on amphibole composition and stability, plagioclase dissolution kinetics upon heating, and formation of sieve-texture via several proposed mechanisms) are germane to a broad spectrum of magmatic settings.","11/29/2016","11/29/2016","1717288","Philipp","Ruprecht","pruprecht@unr.edu","11/29/2016","Principal Investigator","Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno","Reno","895570001","7757844040","1664 North Virginia Street","United States","Nevada","NV","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Who depends on groundwater for drinking water ? Three of four American cities, 95% of the rural American population, and over half of all Americans. Wide scale contamination of groundwater threatens many of these sources. The state-of-the-science for cleaning up contaminated groundwater is mired in 1950s technology because the pollutants and the flowing groundwaters in which they occur are out of sight and very difficult to monitor. This makes it particularly difficult to design so-called 'in situ' clean-up methods, that rely on injecting mixtures into the subsurface to make chemical reactions underground that convert the contaminants to non-toxic products.<br/><br/>The problem to be studied in this project is how groundwater clean-up happens underground. The project will use a recently discovered method of tracking the moving front between the contaminated ('plume') and the non-contaminated groundwater as a basis for predicting the overall rate of chemical transformation in situ. This new method is a recent invention from the theory of turbulence, a field that has challenged human minds since the time of DaVinci, and it promises to provide a much more accurate way of accounting the overall rate of clean-up, even when it is difficult to know exactly the location of the contaminant plume. This project includes both controlled experiments in the laboratory and field site testing to complete the development of this method of designing groundwater clean-up. This innovative and powerful approach does not require the site manager to know exactly where the plume is, like other methods, but it only requires the total surface area of the plume. <br/><br/>The broader significance of this research includes: development of new methods to help federal and state agencies, cities, groundwater contamination responsible parties, and anyone responsible for groundwater quality, to design and manage in situ groundwater remediation strategies all over the United States.

Tuller","Natural disasters are stressful events with cognitive consequences that are poorly understood. In August of 2016, historic flooding in the greater Baton Rouge, LA area resulted in 13 deaths and an estimated 8.7 billion in damages. While this flooding occurred in one region of the country, natural disasters take many forms and can occur in all parts of the United States and around the world. A clear understanding of the consequences of natural disasters on cognition, especially for older adults, has important scientific and societal impacts. The research supported by this award will examine functioning in multiple cognitive domains following a disaster to assess the consequences of stress on cognition and the impact on everyday functioning in a number of real-world situations. The study will measure these cognitive domains at two time points to allow for consideration of how individuals recover following such events. Tracking the relationships among cognitive domains across time has implications for basic understanding of the architecture of cognition as well as how it is influenced by disasters.<br/><br/>In this Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID), Dr. Katie Cherry (Louisiana State University) and her research team will explore several key elements of cognition that relate to functioning ""in the moment."" They will obtain measures of immediate memory, or working memory, sustained attentional resources, long-term memory, and intelligence in a longitudinal design with data collection at two points following disaster exposure. By examining working memory, and its relationship to other key constructs of cognitive functioning, the research team will gain valuable knowledge regarding the consequences of natural disasters on the moment-to-moment cognition that is critical when responding to a disaster. Prior research studies have noted the relationship between working memory and long-term memory as predictors of fluid intelligence, or the ability to detect patterns and solve new problems in the moment, with working memory accounting for unique variance in fluid intelligence. In the current study, the longitudinal association of working memory, sustained attention, long-term memory, and fluid intelligence will provide further evidence of the critical role that working memory plays in fluid intelligence, and will significantly extend prior research by assessing the relationship between these objective measures of cognition and self-appraisals of functioning and sleep disruption in daily life. Additionally, the research team will measure these variables in three groups of participants that vary in degree of flood-related impact and prior losses from previous hurricanes in the South Louisiana region. The research will further consider how adults across the lifespan may show different effects of such disaster-related stress on cognitive functioning. With respect to broader societal impacts, the proposed research will yield critical new evidence to inform understanding of the time course of cognitive vulnerability and recovery after single and multiple disaster exposures.","11/29/2016","11/29/2016","1708090","Katie","Cherry","pskatie@lsu.edu","11/29/2016","Principal Investigator","Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College","Baton Rouge","708032701","2255782760","202 Himes Hall","United States","Louisiana","LA","7252","PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION","7252","Perception, Action and Cognition","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matthew","Calamia","mcalamia@lsu.edu","11/29/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Harlan","Mobile devices are revolutionizing how geoscientists approach field-based research, and new technologies are being developed that are significantly different from methods used by previous generations. For example, hardware built into many smart phones and tablets allow these devices to function as digital geologic compasses. The ease of use and speed of taking digital measurements seem to represent distinct advantages over using an analog geologic compass in the field. However, preliminary investigations suggest that digital compass apps may not provide the accuracy that a professional field geologist needs. To address these concerns, this project will statistically evaluate the relative accuracy of orientation measurements using digital compasses on mobile devices as compared with analog compasses. This project will produce results that impact all geoscientists that use geologic compasses to take orientation measurements, and as such, the potential impacts across geoscience disciplines are substantial. <br/><br/>The project will tap into students' facility with mobile devices to make them the primary collectors of field data. Students in upper-level geology courses will take orientation measurements with both analog and digital compasses, which will then be used for statistical evaluations of the relative accuracy of digital vs. analog compass measurements. The researchers will assess statistical variation in their datasets to include variation between platforms, variation within measurements by observers on different locations in the field, and variation in repeated measurements on the same surface. Statistical analyses, such as Fisher distribution and Watson-Williams analyses, and Bland-Altman tests, will be applied to the field datasets. The researchers will assess the magnitude of the discrepancy and limits of agreement between types of measure and software; the existence of any systematic trends in variation across measurements, platforms, and software; as well as evaluate the consistency of measurement across the range of collected field data. In addition to the practical aspects of the research, the project will contribute to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by the engagement of undergraduate students in the project.","11/30/2016","11/30/2016","1714587","Eric","Pyle","pyleej@jmu.edu","11/30/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","James Madison University","HARRISONBURG","228077000","5405686872","MSC 5728","United States","Virginia","VA","1572","TECTONICS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Steven","Whitmeyer","whitmesj@jmu.edu","11/30/2016","Principal Investigator","1580",NA,NA,NA,"INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On average, women earn approximately 78 cents for every dollar earned by men (Goldin 2015). Professional leaders continue to be overwhelmingly male: among S&P 500 firms, 4.2% of CEOs are female, and women make up only 19.2% of corporate board members (Catalyst 2015a). And, in academia, there continues to be evidence for a leaky pipeline. Half of all tenure-track positions but only 37.5% of tenured positions in the United States in 2013 were held by women (Catalyst 2015b). Within economics, women make up 30% of assistant professors, 23.5% of associate professors, and just 12.1% of full professors (CSWEP 2014). Other STEM disciplines show similar patterns. Developing effective policy interventions demands that we understand more about what drives these patterns. Recent research in experimental economics has indicated that gender differences in preferences, in particular in risk preferences and willingness to compete, have important predictive power for labor market outcomes including occupational choice and earnings. The current project studies gender differences in preferences and their interaction with important labor market institutions. <br/><br/>This project consists of two laboratory experiments. In the first study, the PI explores an under-studied but important labor market decision: willingness to put oneself forward for promotion. She designs a careful laboratory experiment aimed at understanding which features of the labor market environment impact men's and women's willingness to apply for more challenging but higher return work. In the second study, she digs more deeply into the relationship between gender stereotypes and self-confidence, attempting to understand how stereotypical beliefs impact an individual?s confidence in her own ability and how this confidence predicts payoff-relevant decisions. These studies will contribute to a growing literature documenting the importance of gender differences in preferences in predicting labor market outcomes and earnings. These studies both follow the approach of using the controlled environment of the laboratory to isolate a gender difference in the domain of interest and to distinguish between competing explanations for the patterns we observe. Both projects consist of novel experimental frameworks that may be valuable to other researchers; in particular, the adaptable framework she proposes for understanding the decision to apply for promotion lends itself to studying a broader set of workplace-related questions in the future.","11/30/2016","11/30/2016","1713752","Katherine","Coffman","katiebcoffman@gmail.com","11/30/2016","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1320","ECONOMICS","8050","Science of Broadening Participation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This regulation is especially critical under unpredictable fluctuations in the natural environment, which could damage the balance between light input and the capacity of assimilatory reaction to process it. New plant photosynthesis phenotyping platforms have been developed in Dr. David Kramer (co-PI)'s lab, allowing one to determine how the photosynthetic machinery is integrated into cells and is delicately balanced to provide the right amount of energy, at the right times, in the correct forms without damaging the plant. The current major step is to extract useful information from massive plant phenotyping (performance) data to generate testable hypotheses and discover unknown plant energy-related genes and processes. Specifically, the objective is to develop new software approaches for processing, modeling and visualizing sophisticated and overwhelming amount of phenomics data in plant science to forms that are interpretable computers (to classify plants into genetic and performance categories) and by humans (through advanced visualization), leading to new insights on how plants function and new targets for plant improvement. <br/><br/>Large-scale phenotyping (phenomics) promises to bridge the gap between genomics, gene functions and traits. Specifically, to meet our growing needs for food and fuel, new bio-imaging approaches were developed to allow high-throughput, detailed plant phenotyping, with a focus on improving the efficiency of photosynthesis. Dr. Jin Chen (PI) and Dr. David Kramer (co-PI) aim to identify genes and processes that control photosynthesis efficiency in response to fluctuating environmental conditions, which are critical for understanding and improving plant energy storage and improving crop productivity. To achieve this, the research team must resolve a wide range of interacting factors that respond to environmental factors over very wide dynamic ranges of frequency, duration and intensity of conditions. Recently, the Dynamic Environmental Phenotype Imager (DEPI), a novel platform for monitoring responses of plant phenotypes under dynamic conditions has been developed in Dr. David Kramer (co-PI)'s lab. Initial data from DEPI reveals previously unseen effects attributable to genes formerly thought to have no known function. While these developments on plant phenotyping are exciting, researchers are limited by the tools to analyze fully the phenomics data. Removing that limitation is the proposed goal of this project. Dr. Jin Chen (PI) and Dr. David Kramer (co-PI) will discover, develop, and apply Plant Phenomics Data Analytics (PPDA) solutions, such that massive phenomics data is transformed into knowledge or testable hypotheses to identify important genes to improve photosynthesis efficiency under dynamic environmental conditions. PPDA will ensure high data quality, identify and visualize important genes from complex plant phenomics data, and will advance knowledge discovery in the broader community. The project is comprised of four components: Aim 1. Develop, test and apply phenomics data quality control program to identify abnormal data and distinguish whether they arise from noise, artifacts or more interesting cases of altered biological responses. Aim 2. Develop, test and apply phenomics pattern discovery algorithms to identify important energy-related genes from photosynthesis phenomics data. The research team will develop dynamic phenotype network construction and phenotype module discovery algorithms to turn sophisticated phenomics data to testable hypotheses, to discover unknown genes, and to connect biological processes. Aim 3. Develop a data visualization package for complex phenomics data display using integrative multi-dimensional visualization methods, in order to facilitate scientific discovery on energy-related genes in response to changing environmental conditions. Aim 4. Provide proof of utility by applying PPDA to rationale for testing the G protein activation state regulation on photosynthesis efficiency. The researchers will phenotype Arabidopsis thaliana a large informative set of G protein mutants under changing environmental conditions. Then they will apply PPDA to identify genes with emergent functions under subsets of the dynamic environmental conditions. They will resolve the role of G signaling in fluctuation detection.

Nontraditional students have been studied in community colleges and urban universities, but have been rarely studied at public 4-year universities in engineering due to a lack of longitudinal data on individual students. This study uses the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD). MIDFIELD is a longitudinal, multi-institutional, and multivariate dataset of over 209,737 engineering students. MIDFIELD is large enough to provide a better understanding of nontraditional students in public 4 year universities, identify conditions where they are more numerous and more successful, and explore the conditions that support their success. The focus will be on engineering, rather than the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines combined, because engineering has been shown to have unique characteristics. This study will explore the relationship between nontraditional status and student outcomes of interest, such as graduation in engineering, controlling for other relevant factors. Whereas prior research has ignored or masked the contribution of nontraditional students to graduation statistics, this research focuses on nontraditional status and its associated outcomes. Following the development of descriptive statistics, this will be studied in a multivariate setting, comparing the outcomes of nontraditional students to those of traditional students. <br/><br/>Broader significance and importance: <br/><br/>Whereas university attendance was once a privilege of a small fraction of upper class white males, the demographics of college classrooms have changed with society's expectations of a larger and more diverse college-bound population. Graduation statistics are typically reported in ways that have not kept up with these changes. The most commonly reported graduation rate statistics, which are taken from the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System maintained by the Department of Education, ignore part-time time students, students who enroll for the first time in spring rather than fall or summer, and students with more than a proscribed minimum number of credits from other higher education institutions. Thus, even as university students have become more diverse, the success of those students is frequently measured using outdated approaches. By including students ignored by typical techniques, this project will provide a more accurate representation of what happens to today's engineering students. More importantly, by studying what happens to those nontraditional students in particular, this project will draw attention to the educational outcomes of a population that currently comprises 10% of student enrollment, but represents some of the fastest growing pathways in US higher education. The work of this project is possible because it uses a special multi-institution database headquartered at Purdue University created to understand the engineering education system and to make it possible to increase the quantity and quality of engineering degree recipients. <br/><br/>This research is supported by the Research in Engineering Education Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.","12/01/2016","12/01/2016","1700910","Jacqueline","McNeil","j.mcneil@louisville.edu","12/01/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Louisville Research Foundation Inc","Louisville","402021959","5028523788","The Nucleus","United States","Kentucky","KY","1340","ENGINEERING EDUCATION","110E","EDUCATION RESEARCH","1340","ENGINEERING EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lukin","This collaborative research project will advance fundamental understanding of how groups of high speed ions crash into and interact with each other. One can measure just how violent a collision is by comparing the energy of the crashing high-speed ions with the electrical force between them. The most violent ion collisions, the ones that are most important both for extending our scientific knowledge and for developing technological applications, are very difficult to measure or calculate. They occur in extremely hot and very dense gases of charged particles called plasmas. In this project, new ideas will be used to measure and understand these collisions. Lasers will be used to slow atoms from speeds of nearly 1000 meters per second to a crawl of about an inch per second; and then to turn these slow atoms into ions. Additional lasers will then be used to measure how these ions crash into each other. The ions in these slow-motion collisions have the same amount of crash energy compared to the ion-ion electrical force, which means that the collision results can be directly compared to similar collisions at any energy. This project will use state-of-the-art large-scale computer simulations to make movies of the ion-ion collisions and compare these to the experimental measurements. When the computations are proven to be sufficiently accurate, approximations will be gradually introduced and tested in order to speed up the computations. These results will then set the standard for accurate and fast computations of ion collisions in plasmas. Several students will work on this project: Undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scientists will work closely with expert scientists at Willamette University (Oregon), Brigham Young University (Utah), and the New Mexico Consortium (New Mexico).<br/><br/>The proposed collaborative research project will investigate energy relaxation in a system in which the value of the Coulomb logarithm is small. This is typical of high-energy-density systems, where violent small-impact-parameter collisions result in large particle deflections. Understanding these collisions is a priority for advancing fundamental plasma physics and for accurately modeling small impact parameter collisions in high energy density plasmas. The proposed work will generate high quality data in plasma regimes where traditional diagnostics are limited. The proposed work will combine data from a new dual-species ultracold neutral plasma experiment and state-of-the-art simulations to study temperature equilibration in moderately coupled plasmas, in which classic plasma assumptions are invalid. The dual-species plasma will be generated by resonantly photo-ionizing laser-cooled Yb and Ca atoms in the same magneto-optical trap. Laser-induced fluorescence measurements will be used to measure the time-evolving ion velocity distribution for each ion species simultaneously. By delaying the ionization of one species relative to the other, the time scale for full energy relaxation can be determined. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations will be performed that match the density, stoichiometry, and geometry of the experiments. The calculations will provide a first-principles description of collision processes by directly integrating many-body trajectories. Arbitrarily complicated orbits will be computed self-consistently with dynamical many-body screening. The many-body phase dynamics will be inverted to yield highly accurate effective Coulomb logarithms, providing important information back to the high energy density community.

In 2010, shale gas accounted for 23% of annual dry natural gas supply in the US, with projections that this capacity will increase to 48% by 2035. There are large economic advantages of shale gas development, including reliance on domestic production due to the abundance of natural gas in the US and the improved air quality when using natural gas compared with the combustion of gas and coal. This project will examine fugitive emissions, those not controlled in the production well, in a life cycle analyses of the greenhouse gas footprint that include the hydrofracking extraction and production processes.<br/><br/>The development of shale gas resources in the United States is predicted to grow steadily over the next twenty years, however there is large uncertainty surrounding the quantity and mechanisms of fugitive methane emissions released to the atmosphere from these activities. The large range among methane measurements from different hydrofracking sites suggests that fugitive emissions may be largely preventable and are dependent on the practices of the drill and well operators. This project will provide a much needed and timely set of baseline and fugitive methane emission measurements before and during hydrofracking operations that will quantify and identify the sources of methane emissions released during different components of the drilling and gas extraction operations process. This will fill a critical knowledge gap that will inform the development of effective management strategies and operations practices to minimize methane emissions and improve the overall greenhouse gas benefits of natural gas. This project will: (1) Quantify baseline and fugitive methane emissions during hydrofracking by collecting continuous landscape-scale methane flux measurements; (2) Identify biological and geological sources of methane emissions by measuring continuous atmospheric fluxes of 13C isotopes in methane; (3) Attribute measured methane fluxes to different components of the hydrofracking process by using a footprint model and advanced large eddy simulations to isolate flux sources in space and time. This project will leverage ongoing collaboration with the Ohio State University Shale Energy and Environment Field Laboratory (SEEL), which will provide the site access to drilling operations and information about the management practices and operations timeline will be provided through the SEEL partnership with the drill and well operators. The PIs will partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) Extension Office to develop online and print resources and forums for the general public describing the effects of shale gas development on local and regional air and water quality. They will also work with OSU Extension to transfer results from this project to hydrofracking practitioners who could use information regarding drill pad management practices to effectively reduce fugitive methane emissions. The PIs will share the developed products with West Virginia University and Extension, with whom they extensively collaborate on shale gas development issues. Furthermore, they will leverage existing outreach relationships with the Ohio Water Resources Center to present the work related to this project at a water luncheon organized with the Water Management Association of Ohio, and at a separate seminar to state agency representatives. A graduate student will be trained in observation and modeling methods for methane fluxes during this project. This project will also train undergraduate students from the Dartmouth Women in Science Program in fieldwork and data analyses to develop honors theses from this research.","12/02/2016","12/02/2016","1717142","Jaclyn","Matthes","jaclyn.hatala.matthes@gmail.com","12/02/2016","Principal Investigator","Wellesley College","Wellesley","024818204","7812832079","106 Central Street","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1440","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","021E","Water management","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Identifying the organizing principles for such electronic matter will facilitate discovering materials with novel and useful functionalities. The goal of this project is to investigate this theme in two separate venues: Kondo lattices and topological materials. An entanglement of localized states with itinerant electrons in a so-called Kondo lattice leads to a novel electronic state with greatly enhanced mass at low temperature. How exactly this process occurs and its relationship to a further transition into an ordered state will be studied in detail. For this purpose, measurement techniques to probe how electron waves interfere in such a system will be employed. Novel electronic states, called topological, that cannot be continuously transformed to ordinary states can exist in a certain class of materials and they are known to exhibit exotic properties, such as conducting electricity on their boundaries without dissipation while behaving as insulators for transport through the bulk. In this project, the nature of superconductivity induced in these topological states and the elusive Majorana particles that could potentially help in building a quantum computer in the future, will be probed using similar measurement techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will take parts in this project by carrying out experiments and data analysis and attending workshops/conferences to disseminate the results.<br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>Recent years have witnessed resurging interest in understanding the organizing principles for novel quantum matter. This project aims at unraveling the underlying mechanism for emergent phenomena in Kondo lattices and topological materials. The hidden order phase in URu2Si2 has long defied an unambiguous determination of its order parameter. Towards resolving this problem, the detailed hybridization process between localized states and itinerant bands and its relationship to the hidden order transition will be investigated using spectroscopic techniques such as quasiparticle scattering and tunneling. Other closely related Kondo lattice systems will also be studied. Novel topological electronic states emerge due to a combined effect of unconventional band structure and Fermi surface topology. Understanding their underlying physics is a frontier research topic. In this project, the nature of proximity-induced superconductivity in topological materials and Majorana fermions predicted to exist in such systems will be probed using tunneling spectroscopy and other phase-sensitive measurements.

This project presents two approaches leading to such improvements. A first approach is the design and theoretical analysis of imaging methods exploiting physical phenomena in new ways, leading to imaging strategies with both improved contrast and resolution, and providing access to new features such as anisotropic properties of muscle fibers. A second approach is to provide distortion-free reconstructions and accurately located inclusions in human bodies or the Earth's crust. This is achieved by using more realistic descriptions (specifically, spatially varying) of the propagation speed of the waves used to probe the medium of interest. The model considered becomes augmented with new technicalities, where additional phenomena (e.g., caustics) can occur and open mathematical questions abound. The present project provides theoretical and practical imaging answers to some of these new problems. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and mathematical understanding of: (i) coupled-physics inverse problems, which often consist of parameter identification problems in partial differential equations (PDE) using internal measurements; and (ii) geodesic X-ray transforms (a generalization of the famous Radon transform, in two dimensions), with applications to X-Ray Tomography in media with variable index of refraction. In the former topic, methods from analysis and PDEs are used to derive reconstruction algorithms for various models of increasing complexity, including additional constitutive parameters relevant for medical imaging, and including a transition from scalar to systems of PDEs. In the latter topic, the investigator uses tools of integral geometry, Fourier analysis, and PDEs to provide statements about injectivity/stability (or lack thereof), reconstruction formulas and their numerical validation, for the tensor tomography problem on Riemannian surfaces. Generalizations to higher dimensions, attenuated transforms and other types of flows (e.g., magnetic and thermostat flows) are also considered.","12/02/2016","12/02/2016","1712790","Francois","Monard","fmonard@ucsc.edu","12/02/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Santa Cruz","Santa Cruz","950641077","8314595278","1156 High Street","United States","California","CA","1266","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These eigenproblems arise in electronic structure calculation, design of accelerator cavities, delay differential equations, vibration analysis of complex structures, and many more. Structure-preserving linearization techniques that have been developed recently are competitive for small or medium polynomial and rational eigenproblems, but they entail high computational costs for large-scale simulations due to the significantly enlarged dimension of linearized problems. In addition, linearization introduces considerable complications for the development of preconditioners, and it is not applicable to eigenproblems with full nonlinearity. <br/><br/>The PI shall develop novel iterative projection methods that are accurate, robust and efficient, for the solution of large-scale truly nonlinear eigenproblems. This goal can be achieved in part by exploration of special properties of different types of nonlinear eigenproblems that enable solution strategies similar to those for linear eigenproblems. This investigation is focused on ( 1) new preconditioned eigensolvers, including conjugate-gradient-like and minimal-residual-like methods, for efficient solution of a large number of extreme and interior eigenvalues of problems with nonlinearity in eigenvalues, with and without the variational principle; (2) fast inexact Newton-like methods to solve parameter-dependent degenerate eigenproblem for the study of (in)stabilities of dynamical systems; (3) efficient algorithms for solving eigenproblems with nonlinearity in eigenvectors arising from condensed matter physics and electronic structure calculation.

Complex interactions between primary production, decomposition, sedimentation, and sea level rise determine the tipping point relative to the rate of sea-level rise beyond which the marsh converted to open water. Nitrate - the dominant form of coastal N-enrichment - acts as both a powerful electron acceptor stimulating microbial decomposition and as a fertilizer stimulating plant growth with the potential to transform saltmarshes through interactive feedbacks in key plant and microbial processes, potentially lowering the tipping point relative to sea-level rise. It is urgent that we understand the impacts of coastal enrichment on saltmarshes in part because of their globally rapid loss, and in part because salt marshes have become the focus of large-scale restoration strategies costing millions to billions of dollars to serve as storm buffers for coastal cities and as ""blue"" carbon pools to mitigate climate change. The TIDE saltmarsh experiment is a unique ecosystem-scale test of how nutrient enrichment affects ecosystem structure, function, and long-term sustainability. Contrary to well-accepted saltmarsh models, TIDE has shown that nutrients can drive saltmarsh loss; however, important questions about causality, and whether geomorphic and ecosystem function will continue to change or reach a new landscape equilibrium with nutrient loading, remain unanswered. Given the ongoing changes observed the project to date the PI will continue the experiment for a total of 13 years to address: (1) long-term landscape evolution (autocatalytic or self-limiting?), (2) plant mechanisms (Is environmental filtering selecting for plants with lower belowground biomass that are less flood tolerant?); (3) microbial mechanisms (Does NO3- remove resource limitation on the microbes and disproportionately stimulate creek bank denitrifiers/decomposers?); and (4) the consequences for ecosystem function (With loss of creek edge marsh, do saltmarshes retain less N?). The investigators will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, genetic approaches, common garden experiments, and enriched 15N-NO3 - additions and delta 15N values in ecosystem components to understand mechanisms underlying ecosystem geomorphic and N cycle changes. This project incorporates new researchers to address questions of geomorphologic change, plant and microbial genetics, gene expression, whole-system ecosystem nutrient cycling, and denitrification.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This interdisciplinary project involving ecosystem, plant, microbial, biogeochemical, and geological researchers will test fundamental questions about controls on ecosystem structure and function and the long-term sustainability of nutrient enriched wetlands. Many detritus-based wetland ecosystems worldwide (boreal, tundra, salt- and fresh-water wetlands) are unexpectedly crossing tipping points suggesting there is a need to re-assess our theories and understanding on the nature and pace of their response to perturbation. Developing a predictive understanding of the controls on tipping points in natural ecosystems, and how these tipping points are altered by human activities, represents a major challenge in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader social impacts of this project lie in addressing a globally important issue, coastal eutrophication. The educational impacts include enhancing high school to graduate student interdisciplinary training through a structured rotation among disciplines and hands-on field research. New partnerships with minority serving institutions and a RUI women's college will engage urban, underprivileged and minority students. A whole-ecosystem experiment is supported as a living lab for education and research infrastructure for the scientific community.

This changing paradigm is leading to tight coupling of the cyber- infrastructure with multiple physical- world infrastructures, including air transportation and electric power systems. These management-coupled cyber- and physical- infrastructures (MCCPIs) are subject to complex threats from natural and sentient adversaries, which can enact complex propagative impacts across networked physical-, cyber-, and human elements. <br/><br/>We propose here to develop a modeling framework and tool suite for threat assessment for MCCPIs. The proposed modeling framework for MCCPIs has three aspects: 1) a tractable moment-linear modeling paradigm for the hybrid, stochastic, and multi-layer dynamics of MCCPIs; 2) models for sentient and natural adversaries, that capture their measurement and actuation capabilities in the cyber- and physical- worlds, intelligence, and trust-level; and 3) formal definitions for information security and vulnerability. The attendant tool suite will provide situational awareness of the propagative impacts of threats. Specifically, three functionalities termed Target, Feature, and Defend will be developed, which exploit topological characteristics of an MCCPI to evaluate and mitigate threat impacts. We will then pursue analyses that tie special infrastructure-network features to security/vulnerability. As a central case study, the framework and tools will be used for threat assessment and risk analysis of strategic air traffic management. Three canonical types of threats will be addressed: environmental-to-physical threats, cyber-physical co-threats, and human-in-the-loop threats.

Drought-tolerant bioenergy crops growing on arid, marginal lands, such as Agave and Opuntia, which store large amounts of water and carbohydrates, have enormous potential as dedicated biofuel feedstocks because they do not compete with food production and minimize the use of water and fertilizer resources. However, the lack of water-use efficient and cost-effective bio-refining processes hinders the deployment of biofuel production facilities in vast arid and semi-arid areas that cover more than 40% of the world?s land surface.<br/><br/>This project will develop an integrated pathway to convert arid land plants into advanced biofuels with high water-use efficiency. The key step is the catalytic aqueous phase partial oxidation (APPO), a novel, environmentally benign biomass deconstruction process that can selectively synthesize valued carboxylic acids using water and lean air as the reaction media and metal oxides as non-toxic catalysts. APPO is also a water-positive process because it utilizes wet biomass as the feedstock, retaining water stored in raw biomass, and produces extra water during the processing of biomass. The reclaimed water from the APPO process can supplement water resources for cultivating bioenergy crops. Moreover, the APPO products (e.g., levulinic acid) can be upgraded readily into drop-in transportation fuel components consisting of mainly hydrocarbons. In short, APPO is a highly promising, cost-effective biomass deconstruction process with high water-use efficiency, which is critical for commercial production of advanced biofuels in vast arid and semi-arid lands in the United States and around the world.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to explore the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms that control the biomass deconstruction in the APPO process and to demonstrate the water sustainability in the integrated biofuel production process by recycling water between the conversion and cultivation of the bioenergy crops. To fulfill this goal, the PIs will investigate the fundamentals of the APPO process by in-depth experimental and theoretical studies and build a life cycle analysis (LCA) model to evaluate water usage. The outcomes of this project will guide the design of highly efficient and robust APPO catalysts for cost-effective production of advanced biofuels, and will predict the feasibility of commercial biorefineries in water-limited locations such as Nevada and the entire western United States.<br/><br/>This project will integrate research on chemical engineering, agriculture, environment, and biofuels with educational and outreach efforts to demonstrate the importance of science and engineering. The results from this proposal will be disseminated across a wide audience through the Nevada Renewable Energy Consortium (NVREC). The newest research outcomes will be presented to groups across campus as well as the local community in the Biofuels/Biomass Journal Club at UNR.

Nitrate - the dominant form of coastal N-enrichment - acts as both a powerful electron acceptor stimulating microbial decomposition and as a fertilizer stimulating plant growth with the potential to transform saltmarshes through interactive feedbacks in key plant and microbial processes, potentially lowering the tipping point relative to sea-level rise. It is urgent that we understand the impacts of coastal enrichment on saltmarshes in part because of their globally rapid loss, and in part because salt marshes have become the focus of large-scale restoration strategies costing millions to billions of dollars to serve as storm buffers for coastal cities and as ""blue"" carbon pools to mitigate climate change. The TIDE saltmarsh experiment is a unique ecosystem-scale test of how nutrient enrichment affects ecosystem structure, function, and long-term sustainability. Contrary to well-accepted saltmarsh models, TIDE has shown that nutrients can drive saltmarsh loss; however, important questions about causality, and whether geomorphic and ecosystem function will continue to change or reach a new landscape equilibrium with nutrient loading, remain unanswered. Given the ongoing changes observed by the project to date, the PI will continue the experiment for a total of 13 years to address: (1) long-term landscape evolution (autocatalytic or self-limiting?), (2) plant mechanisms (Is environmental filtering selecting for plants with lower belowground biomass that are less flood tolerant?); (3) microbial mechanisms (Does NO3- remove resource limitation on the microbes and disproportionately stimulate creek bank denitrifiers/decomposers?); and (4) the consequences for ecosystem function (With loss of creek edge marsh, do saltmarshes retain less N?). The investigators will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, genetic approaches, common garden experiments, and enriched 15N-NO3 - additions and delta 15N values in ecosystem components to understand mechanisms underlying ecosystem geomorphic and N cycle changes. This project incorporates new researchers to address questions of geomorphologic change, plant and microbial genetics, gene expression, whole-system ecosystem nutrient cycling, and denitrification.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This interdisciplinary project involving ecosystem, plant, microbial, biogeochemical, and geological researchers will test fundamental questions about controls on ecosystem structure and function and the long-term sustainability of nutrient enriched wetlands. Many detritus-based wetland ecosystems worldwide (boreal, tundra, salt- and fresh-water wetlands) are unexpectedly crossing tipping points suggesting there is a need to re-assess our theories and understanding on the nature and pace of their response to perturbation. Developing a predictive understanding of the controls on tipping points in natural ecosystems, and how these tipping points are altered by human activities, represents a major challenge in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader social impacts of this project lie in addressing a globally important issue, coastal eutrophication. The educational impacts include enhancing high school to graduate student interdisciplinary training through a structured rotation among disciplines and hands-on field research. New partnerships with minority serving institutions and a RUI women's college will engage urban, underprivileged and minority students. A whole-ecosystem experiment is supported as a living lab for education and research infrastructure for the scientific community. The MBL's Science Journalism Program and the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge will be used to showcase the results to the public. Management outreach through workshops co-hosted with EPA and the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve will engage local, state and federal managers.","12/04/2016","12/04/2016","1719621","Linda","Deegan","ldeegan@mbl.edu","12/04/2016","Principal Investigator","Woods Hole Research Center","Falmouth","025401644","5084441526","149 Woods Hole Road","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, human control of assistive robots presents substantial challenges. The high dimensionality of robotic arms means that joystick-like interfaces are unnatural hard to use intuitively, and motions resulting from direct teleoperation are often slow, imprecise, and severely limited in their dexterity. This research address these challenges by developing learning algorithms for shared autonomy, where the robot anticipates the user's intent and provides a degree of assistive autonomy to ensure fluid and successful motions. This research will also pave the way for future research that can bootstrap from teleoperation and build towards full robot autonomy. <br/><br/>The research proposes a hierarchical and multi-phased approach to shared autonomy, using techniques from deep learning and reinforcement learning. The system begins by using deep inverse reinforcement learning to quickly ascertain the user's high-level goal, such as whether the user wants to grasp a particular object or operate an appliance, from raw sensory inputs. This goal inference layer supplies objectives to the lower control layer, which consists of deep neural network control policies that can directly process raw sensory input about the environment and the user to make decisions. These policies choose low-level controls to satisfy the high-level objective while minimizing disagreement with the user's commands. The algorithms will be deployed and tested on a wheelchair-mounted robot arm with the potential to assist users with upper extremity disabilities to perform activities of daily living.","12/06/2016","12/06/2016","1700696","Sergey","Levine","sergey.levine@gmail.com","12/06/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","8013","National Robotics Initiative","8086","Natl Robotics Initiative (NRI)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

D. students and junior researchers from different countries. Its objectives are to present and discuss the latest results on the geometric aspects and dynamics of resonances, share points of view and ideas, and to strengthen or promote interactions. The conference will give Ph.D. students and young scientists the opportunity to meet some of the prominent researchers in the fields related to resonances and to exchange ideas with them. To make the more specialized talks accessible to the participants, some experts will give tutorial and survey talks. Moreover, two afternoons will be devoted to talks of junior participants. This will give the Ph.D. students and the postdocs the possibility of presenting their work, which is an essential step for entering in the world of research and for building scientific collaborations. <br/><br/>The notion of resonance was introduced in quantum mechanics to study metastable states of a system, that is long-lived states from which the system deviates only with sufficiently strong disturbances. Mathematically, resonances appear either as discrete eigenvalues of the quantization of a classical Hamiltonian or as the eigenvalues of the transfer operator of the classical flow. Their study, initially aimed at Schroedinger operators on R^n, was extended to more geometric situations. Because of the role they play in various physical contexts there has been a considerable progress in understanding the geometry and the analysis of classical and quantum resonances in the last years. Nevertheless, many important and basic questions are still open. Many difficulties preventing to use classical arguments arise because of the non-self-adjoint nature of resonances. Also, in the geometric case of (locally) symmetric spaces, very little is known when the rank of the spaces is bigger than 1. Partial advances have been obtained, with several different approaches, using either harmonic analysis and representation theory, or microlocal analysis and techniques from scattering theory such as complex scaling. To study resonances in higher dimensional and higher rank geometric situations, a joint effort of different mathematical communities is therefore needed, and young researchers should have contacts with experts from the various aspects of the theory to make significant progress.

However, experimental evidence for trade-offs between alternative defense mechanisms is scarce. The ideal system to test for immune response tradeoffs would be a group of closely related host species that face similar parasites in the wild, and that employ multiple kinds of defenses. The investigators will use fruit flies of the melanogaster species group of the genus Drosophila, along with their shared endoparasitoid wasps from the family Figitidae, to test the hypothesis that cellular and behavioral immune defenses trade off with each other on a macro-evolutionary scale. The investigators will take advantage of the fact that D. melanogaster is a genetic model system to test the suspected roles of sight and brain neuropeptide F signaling in fly self-medication responses against wasp parasites. The investigators will also take a combined RNA-seq and association mapping approach to uncover further brain genes required for initiating behavioral defenses. This project will result in the identification of evolutionary trade-offs between different immune mechanisms as well as the mechanistic and genetic underpinnings of behavioral immune responses. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the project include the maintenance and distribution of parasitic wasp strains for the scientific community and the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in aspects of behavior, cellular biology, and genetics.

The workshop will bring together technology leaders to develop a roadmap for basic research supporting development of small-scale, modular, chemical manufacturing facilities as an alternative to conventional huge-scale chemical plants. The modular alternative offers potential advantages for the utilization of chemical feedstocks that are remotely located and cannot be economically transported to centralized processing facilities. Successful development and implementation of modular manufacturing facilities will ensure sustained competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry while also addressing environmental challenges and promoting clean energy technology.<br/><br/>The rapid emergence of large reserves of natural gas derived from shale oil fracturing operations has created a challenge in utilizing the gas. Much of the so-called stranded gas produced in remote locations is burned because of poor economics for transporting it to power-plants or chemical plants. Modular, scalable, processing units that can be installed at the well-head, offer a means of converting these hydrocarbon gases to transportable liquid fuels and chemicals. The modular units can only be successfully deployed if heretofore unrealized levels of process intensification and integration can be achieved. This, in turn, will require unprecedented collaboration among engineers and scientists across disciplines involving catalysis, reactor engineering, separations, energy utilization, and systems engineering. The workshop will explore the most efficient mechanisms for achieving such collaboration. Benefits of the technology will include improved process technologies for implementation across all manufacturing scales, and societal benefits including reduced carbon dioxide emissions, safer chemical processing, workforce training, and continued world-wide competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1700994","Dionisios","Vlachos","vlachos@udel.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Delaware","Newark","197162553","3028312136","210 Hullihen Hall","United States","Delaware","DE","1401","Catalysis","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1403","1417","7644",NA,"Proc Sys, Reac Eng & Mol Therm","Process Separations",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The experiment consisted of adding acid, nitrogen, and sulfur to the forest by helicopter every other month. Starting in early 2017 and extending over a one-year period, samples of soil and stream water will be collected and analyzed for changes in their chemical composition. The researchers will sample a stream in the watershed that had been subjected to additions and a stream in another watershed that did not receive additions. Samples will be collected from streams under periods of normal flow when there are no storms and during storms as storms change how water moves from the landscape to the streams and storms increase the flow within the streams. The prior additions to the forested watershed were done as part of a long-term study of the effects of acid precipitation. However, over the past 25 years Eastern North America and Europe have experienced dramatic declines in the amounts of sulfur and nitrogen that are deposited on landscapes from the atmosphere. During that same time period forest ecosystems have also experienced changes in climate and other disturbances that include ice storms, land development, and outbreaks of insects and disease. The overlap in a decline in acid precipitation with increased levels of other disturbances make it difficult to isolate the influences of the decline in atmospheric inputs alone. The abrupt end to the experimental additions of nitrogen and sulfur provides a unique opportunity to assess forest ecosystem responses to those inputs while all other disturbances are held relatively constant. As a result, this research has the potential to test hypotheses about how the chemistry of organic molecules dissolved in surface waters and the movement of sulfur through soils will change with reductions in acid precipitation. The increased understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics has the potential to influence policy at the state and national level, associated with the stewardship of forests and their ecosystem services such as providing a source of high quality drinking water.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a unique scientific opportunity associated with a whole watershed manipulation. Stopping the 27-year experimental additions of nitrogen and sulfur to West Bear Brook watershed in October 2016 will allow the researchers to compare the responses in West Bear Brook to the changes observed in a reference watershed, East Bear Brook watershed. The researchers will sample the streams under base flow conditions and during storms to test hypotheses about why increases in dissolved organic matter concentrations in some streams, referred to as browning of the waters, have occurred as acidic atmospheric deposition has diminished. The research should allow the scientists to distinguish changes observed with the abrupt cessation of atmospheric additions from the long-term changes that could be the result of climate change and forestland development. Characterization of dissolved organic carbon will employ state of the art spectrophotometric, fluorescence, and molecular methodologies to test hypotheses about the nature of organic matter and mineral complexes in the soil. The researchers will also study mechanisms of recovery driven by declining sulfate export from soils, will sample soils from the long-term soil plots at the end of the first year of recovery to capture potential initial evidence of alterations in soil chemistry, and ultimately hope to gain a better understanding of the sequence of changing chemistry in soils and streams with particular reference to aluminum. The project will include participation by undergraduate and graduate students, with linkages to K-12 teachers and students at a local high school.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1704200","Stephen","Norton","norton@maine.edu","12/07/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Maine","ORONO","044695717","2075811484","5717 Corbett Hall","United States","Maine","ME","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ivan","Fernandez","ivanjf@maine.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sarah","Nelson","sarah.j.nelson@maine.edu","12/07/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","Michael","SanClements","michael.sanclements@colorado.edu","12/07/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Edmonds","In this project, investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure the concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, copper, cadmium, and nickel from a variety of seawater and ice samples in the Western Arctic Ocean. These are commonly referred to as 'micronutrients' because they are present in the ocean in extremely low concentrations and because they are essential for marine organisms. In common with other national initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The six trace elements to be measured in this study are arguably the most important bioactive trace elements in the oceans, and their measurement will provide key information on biological and physical processes in the Arctic. This project will be carried out under the direction of a postdoctoral researcher, providing a unique professional development opportunity for an early career scientist. In addition, the research will involve the training of an undergraduate researcher, and provide public outreach opportunities to K-12 teachers and students, and indigenous populations in Alaska.<br/><br/>The six micronutrients to be measured under this project have all been identified as key trace elements for the GEOTRACES Program. This research will allow rigorous testing of the Arctic physical and biological processes, many of which are already undergoing fundamental changes as a result of climate change, that control the inputs and fate of key micronutrient metals in the Arctic Ocean. Colloidal distributions are specifically targeted in order to derive additional information on the unique physicochemical form and reactivity of distinct dissolved metal pools. The project will also explore the role of melting sea ice in driving near-surface concentrations of these elements by measuring concentrations and size partitioning of these six metals in sea ice, snow, melt ponds, and in the seawater immediately under sea ice. Given that the Arctic is a relatively small basin surrounded by broad continental shelves, sedimentary sources and sinks will also play a major role in controlling the distributions of these elements. Thus, metal concentrations in porewater samples from bottom sediments will also be determined from cores in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, in order to investigate benthic exchanges.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1713677","Jessica","Fitzsimmons","jessfitz@tamu.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M University Main Campus","College Station","778454375","9798626777","400 Harvey Mitchell Pkwy South","United States","Texas","TX","1670","CHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","9156","ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY","9189","WATER RESOURCES/COASTAL & MARINE ENVIRON",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stress and strain can slightly alter these bonds, but cause profound changes in the way that materials interact with both light and electrical charge. Germanium is particularly noteworthy in this regard. A 2% change in bond length enables it to emit light very efficiently while in its normal state, germanium is a poor light emitter. This project seeks to engineer the properties of germanium nanostructures by embedding them into a matrix that induces stress. Nanocomposites formed from Ge nanostructures embedded in a foreign host enable new optical and electrical properties. The research project is integrated with the education and outreach activities. Besides interdisciplinary research training provided at the graduate and undergraduate levels, the PI schedules regular meetings with junior faculty in engineering to discuss how K-12 outreach can improve work-life balance, a growing concern among academic scientists. Through these outreach activities, he uses his personal experience to encourage junior faculty members in developing innovative outreach activities. Another activity involves pre-college outreach to talented seniors at Wilbur Cross High School, a racially and economically diverse public high school in New Haven.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>This project aims to demonstrate novel nanocomposite materials consisting of tensile-strained Ge nanowires embedded in III-V matrices. Recent research has shown that the properties of Ge nanomembranes, nanowires, microdisks, and microbridges can be tuned using external stressors to apply large biaxial or uniaxial tensile strains. In this project, surface-mediated phase separation during molecular beam epitaxy growth is investigated as a new approach to grow epitaxial Ge nanostructures embedded in a III-V matrix with high tensile strain. Specifically, Task 1 seeks to draw connections between growth conditions, structure, and properties of Ge/III-V nanocomposites, including basic understanding of interfacial strain coupling; Task 2 focuses on the coupled effects of matrix composition and lattice constant on the kinetics of Ge phase separation and the resulting microstructures. Finally task 3 seeks to understand the changes in structure and properties when the nanowires are modulated into nanorods or quantum dots. The ability to design and grow Ge/III-V nanocomposites with previously unattainable strain states may lead to a range of unprecedented material properties for Ge, such as the indirect-gap to direct-gap conversion or even becoming a semi-metallic material. Moreover, the fundamental understanding of epitaxial nanocomposites could apply to a wide range of other material systems such as complex oxides, dilute magnetic semiconductors, and highly mismatched alloys.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1713068","Minjoo","Lee","mllee@illinois.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1775","ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS","6863","SEBML-MOORE'S LAW","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8990","Optics and Photonics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Welkom","The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar at the intersection of several fields of science: Human Evolution, Biomechanics, Evolutionary Modeling and Primatology to investigate the origins of the peculiar type of locomotion (also called knuckle-walking) that is used only by our closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, and may have been used by our earliest ancestors. This bizarre form of locomotion has led to decades of research focusing on why an animal would knuckle-walk over any other form of locomotion, and when and how many times it has evolved. However, critical to addressing any hypotheses concerning the origin of knuckle-walking are basic data that allow the Fellow to understand how it works. By fully understanding how knucklewalking works, the project team will be able to directly investigate the origin and evolution of knucklewalking in apes. This will enable the team to infer its presence in fossil apes as well as the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The project has substantial collaboration with scientists and students in Rwanda, going much deeper beyond simply doing fieldwork and data collection. The research team will host Rwandan university students for internships, and students conducting their senior research at the Karisoke Research Center. This project also facilitates opportunities to engage Rwandan undergraduate students and early career scientists. Through this type of international collaboration, US scientists, postdoctoral scholars and students engage in meaningful research to advance the state of the art in the field of anthropology and biomechanics.<br/><br/>In this project, a team of scientists utilize state-of-the-art laboratory- and field-based biomechanical analyses of locomotion in chimpanzees, gorillas, and macaques, as well as phylogenetic comparative methodologies in order to test assumptions about the evolution of this unique form of locomotion, and to understand how, when, and how many times this locomotor behavior evolved. Specifically, in this project the team of scientists will: 1) perform a 3-D jointlevel mechanical analysis of knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and digitigrade/palmigrade walking in macaques, 2) create a computational model that allows for examination of the benefits of knuckle-walking over other forms of terrestrial locomotion, 3) use evolutionary modeling to track the evolution of knuckle-walking in the hominoid tree of life and to infer its presence in fossil apes, and 4) develop protocols for collecting non-invasive 3-D field kinematic data from wild, critically endangered mountain gorillas, including knuckle-walking. The broader impacts of this research will target both scientific and educational domains. The researchers will develop protocols to investigate locomotion in wild, critically endangered mountain gorillas. This will not only provide never-before-seen insights into gorilla locomotion, but the protocols will be widely applicable to other endangered species. Moreover, this project will support the research of an early-career scientist, and will involve mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. By training the next generation of scientists and creating freely-available data resources and research protocols, this project will facilitate discoveries about the origin of our closest living ape relatives, as well as the origin of our own species, that go far beyond the present project. The project involves international collaboration at multiple levels, and is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1719432","Nathan","Thompson","nthomp03@nyit.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","New York Institute of Technology","Old westbury","115688000","5166867737","Northern Boulevard","United States","New York","NY","8209","SPRF-IBSS","7541","RWANDA","5956","IRFP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5956",NA,NA,NA,"IRFP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Garrison","All reef-building corals require large numbers of internal symbiotic microalgae (called Symbiodinium) for their survival and growth. These mutualisms have shown considerable sensitivity to changes in the environment in recent decades, especially due to global increases in ocean temperatures. When exposed to severe thermal stress, corals loose their symbionts and often die. However, recent experiments show that some symbionts may be more stress-tolerant. Corals with these heat-resistant symbionts continue to receive high amounts of algal derived nutrients and grow under elevated temperatures. If the global trend in seawater warming continues to increase, these heat-resistant symbioses may become more ecologically prevalent on reef systems around the world and could play a critical role in maintaining healthy and productive coral communities. This project will examine the ecological and physiological attributes of stress-tolerant symbioses from the Indo Pacific where coral communities are the largest, most diverse, and productive in the world. The researchers will conduct a series of experiments to (1) evaluate host and symbiont attributes that contribute to thermal tolerance and (2) characterize the relative flexibility and functionality of various corals and symbionts exposed to typical ambient and stressful temperatures. Broader impacts of the project include the training of several Ph.D. students, undergraduates, and high school students in the disciplines of physiology and ecology. The researchers will partner with Global Ocean Exploration, Inc. to communicate this research to the general public through short documentary videos, editorials, and podcasts. An interactive K-5 program, ""Invertebrates on the Road,"" will introduce elementary students in Pennsylvania to marine invertebrate diversity. Research results will also be disseminated to the public at the University of Delaware via educational seminars, as well as through hands-on research displays and demonstrations presented at the annual open house ""Coast Day"" festival in each year of the project. <br/><br/>This project will examine several attributes important to the functional ecology of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses. Specifically, the research team seeks to understand the interplay between coral and symbiont physiologies under different environmental conditions and determine the relative influence of biotic factors crucial to the performance of stress tolerant symbioses. Results from recent experiments on Indo-west Pacific corals found that Clade D (S. trenchii) symbionts are stress-tolerant. These symbionts are able to maintain function and provide nutrients to their hosts under high temperatures that typically elicit the breakdown of symbioses involving many other species of symbiont. A number of questions arise about how enhanced thermal tolerance symbioses may be aided by a combination of factors; for example: Are symbionts physiologically hardier in corals that are routinely feeding? Do host genotypes that are adapted to high temperatures affect the physiology of their symbionts in ways that make the partnership more stress-tolerant? A series of experiments over three years will examine the functionality of different coral-symbiont pairings exposed to ambient and high temperatures. Reciprocal transplants between inshore (stress-tolerant) and offshore (stress-susceptible) reef sites will be used to produce specific host-symbiont parings. Controlled experiments will test the relative importance of coral trophic status (nutrient content) while holding symbiont type constant and how changes in both coral trophic status and symbiont species identity of the resident affect thermal tolerance. Tank experiments on shore will track rates of photosynthesis as well as carbon translocation and assimilation from symbiont to host tissues and skeletons. Long-term growth rates via skeletal density, linear extension, and biomass gain will also be measured. This project will help elucidate how biochemical, physiological and ecological differences among host-symbiont pairings may respond to rising ocean temperatures and enhance the future viability of coral reefs.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1719684","Dustin","Kemp","dwk@uab.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Alabama at Birmingham","Birmingham","352940001","2059345266","AB 1170","United States","Alabama","AL","1650","BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","1097","DIVERSITY: ROLE IN ECOSYSTEMS","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","7657","Integrative Ecologi Physiology","8556","Coral Reefs","9117","MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fisher","Network traffic classification - assigning incoming packets to classes for processing based on pattern-matching rules - is critical for many network management tasks, including performance monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, as the number of classification tasks grows, the resources required to store and apply the rules (switch memory in particular) can become scarce. This project takes an end-to-end view of traffic classification, observing that in addition to the memory usage at switches, other, cheaper resources are involved in packet processing, specifically bandwidth to transfer selected packets to the receivers, and the receiver systems themselves. The proposed approach trades off memory for bandwidth by introducing overselection, in which approximate classification made in reduced memory introduces additional unwanted traffic. The idea is that in many applications, the side-effects of overselection are quite manageable; the project will investigate multiple types of applications such as middleboxes and packet scrubbers that can tolerate overselection. <br/><br/>The approach involves a Cuckoo-filter-based approximate prefix matcher at switches, which stores classification rules with different prefix lengths. The key challenges in supporting distributed approximate packet classification include: (1) new data structures that best support the tradeoffs between memory and overselection; (2) new algorithms and systems that handle traffic dynamics and network dynamics with overselection; (3) systematic analysis of the impact of overselection on different network functions; and (4) spatial and temporal coordination of switches and receivers. This project will enable innovations and redesign of these management applications relying on traffic classification in software defined networks (SDN), and thus lead to more efficiently managed enterprise and datacenter networks. Moreover, the work will facilitate interactions among theoretical and systems research. Finally, the principal investigators have a record of engaging underrepresented groups and undergraduates in research and plan to continue these engagements as part of this project.","12/07/2016","12/07/2016","1701923","Minlan","Yu","minlan.yu@yale.edu","12/07/2016","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7923","SMALL PROJECT","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this project, impurities such as copper, silver and gold are added in controlled amounts to a system containing the precursors of the hoped-for semiconductor crystals. The location and nature of the impurities is then studied using a technique involving X-rays. The work is allowing the investigators to develop a detailed understanding of how the impurities find their way into the semiconductor crystal and whether and how they move around within the crystal structure.

The primary intellectual merit of the conference is in its potential to catalyze collaboration across diverse physics fields.<br/><br/>This conference is aligned with NSF interests in developing a diverse workforce. On-campus experiments will give under-represented minorities (URMs) and women who are undergraduates hands-on detector experience. These experiments usually have small numbers of collaboration members, hence workshops such as this are particularly important for broadly disseminating the plans for such experiments and recruiting new collaborators. The funding to attend the conference is targeted at junior scientists and the organizers will aim for gender equity and will recruit URMs as participants.<br/><br/>This award provides funds to support travel for attendees to a workshop that will bring together scientists to discuss about 20 new experiments that can be performed with under 20 collaborators and modest funding. Such experiments span a range of techniques from nuclear, particle, and atomic physics, and represent a variety of programs within the NSF physics division. By bringing together experts promoting a unique collection of research programs, using a wide variety of experimental techniques, it is hoped to form a community where ideas can be exchanged and collaborations can be formed.","12/08/2016","12/08/2016","1707700","Janet","Conrad","conrad@mit.edu","12/08/2016","Principal Investigator","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Cambridge","021394301","6172531000","77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7235","Particle Astrophysics/Undergro","7483","PHYSICS OF THE UNIVERSE","8990","Optics and Photonics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1241","1234","1221",NA,"AMO Experiment/Atomic, Molecul","NUCLEAR PRECISION MEASUREMENTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stark","Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS 1406337, Principal Investigator: Xin Zhou <br/><br/>The physical description of a soap film spanning a wire boundary leads to an important class of surfaces in geometry, called ""minimal surface"", because the energy-minimization condition that the soap film satisfies corresponds to a surface of least area, at least among nearby surfaces. Also as intrinsic geometric objects of the underlying space, minimal surfaces can be viewed as non-linear analog of the eigenstates in Quantum Mechanics. The mathematical problem that amounts to showing that every bounding wire is spanned by at least one soap film has been studied in detail for many years and admits many important generalizations. Most of the previous techniques for proving such existence properties focused on the ""minimizing theory"", which corresponds to finding the ground state in Quantum Mechanics. One natural but very difficult technique, called the ""min-max theory"", corresponding to finding the excited states in Quantum Mechanics (i.e. the eigenstates with energy higher than the ground state), has had striking recent successes, and will be one of the major objects of study in this research program. Another project will study geometric inequalities in general relativity, particularly aiming to understand the mass angular momentum inequalities for axisymmetric initial data sets which model rotating galaxies in astrophysics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the principal investigator will study the min-max theory for minimal surfaces via both the geometric measure theory approach and the harmonic map approach. Concerning the geometric measure theory approach, some of the aspects of the min-max theory to be studied in this research program include extensions of the PI's index bound theorem beyond positive Ricci curvature conditions, as well as versions of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory for more general ambient spaces, including manifolds with boundary and smooth metric measure spaces (where the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor plays a role). Certain geometric problems related to the Min-max theory will be studied, such as Hersch-type estimates for higher-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with bounded Morse index. Concerning the min-max theory via harmonic maps, the PI intends to study the issue of Morse index and branch points of the min-max minimal surfaces constructed by Colding-Minicozzi and himself, and the corresponding free boundary problem.","12/08/2016","12/08/2016","1704393","Xin","Zhou","zhou@math.ucsb.edu","12/08/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Santa Barbara","Santa Barbara","931062050","8058934188","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","1265","GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research will ultimately lead to a framework to automatically learn, validate, and apply context dependent model simplification rules that can be audited by human experts, and deployed to automate the model simplification task.<br/><br/>If successful, the research will significantly speed up model simplification, and enhance the automated use of engineering analysis tools in the design process. Potential applications include design of heat exchangers, aircraft structures, and semi-conductor equipment. The planned research and education integration activities and outreach activities will familiarize graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with the use of model simplification technologies in challenging engineering design projects. This project will also increase awareness among practicing engineers about the potential usage of automated model simplification in complex engineering design projects. Students working on this project will also participate in Badger Camp and Engineering Expo events at the University of Wisconsin campus and Maryland Day at the University of Maryland to enhance the public understanding of the science and technology.","12/09/2016","12/09/2016","1713921","Satyandra","Gupta","guptask@usc.edu","12/09/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Southern California","Los Angeles","900890001","2137407762","University Park","United States","California","CA","1464","ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT","067E","DESIGN TOOLS","068E","DESIGN THEORY","073E","OPTIMIZATION & DECISION MAKING","9148","TOOLS & TECHNOL FOR MANUFACTURING DESIGN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research outlined in this proposal aims to address the future energy demand of global society by developing a practical solution that can balance the high performance of gallium arsenide solar cells with their production cost, and therefore enable their large-scale deployment in terrestrial photovoltaics. The highly multidisciplinary themes of the proposed research will be intimately integrated with comprehensive teaching and outreach efforts. PI Yoon will work with the Center for Engineering Diversity at the University of Southern California to establish laboratory internship opportunities for educationally-disadvantaged middle and high school students in the inner city of Los Angeles. Co-PI Lee will partner with Yale Science Outreach on two particular programs: Science on Saturdays for families and the general public and the Pathways to Science program for middle and high school students. Training both undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be a primary educational goal, where the PIs will continue to support and encourage broadening participation of female students and students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this collaborative research is to demonstrate high performance, cost-competitive GaAs solar cells for their large-scale deployment in terrestrial photovoltaics. To achieve this goal, we will develop novel strategies of materials growth and device fabrication exploiting (1) an ultrathin device platform that enables efficient use of expensive source materials, (2) multilayer epitaxial growth that can significantly reduce the cost of epitaxial materials, (3) bifacial nanophotonic light manipulation that can enhance the absorption, (4) high yield printing techniques that permits large-area distribution over low cost substrates. Specifically, Task 1 will explore the growth of multiple device stacks of ultrathin GaAs solar cells in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) targeting uniform materials properties and device performance of multilayer-grown epitaxial stacks. Task 2 will seek to establish fundamental understanding and optimization of the epitaxial design for ultrathin GaAs solar cells to enhance the carrier collection and maximize the effectiveness of light trapping. Task 3 will focus on developing integrated schemes of bifacial photon management for light trapping and photon recycling. Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to the development of high performance, economically viable GaAs solar cells for terrestrial applications and also strengthen fundamental understanding of: materials behaviors and dopant diffusion in MBE-grown multilayer epitaxial assemblies; optimized layer structures of ultrathin GaAs solar cells for the most efficient photovoltaic energy conversion; multifunctional optical designs for maximized light absorption in the optically thin absorber.","12/09/2016","12/09/2016","1719567","Minjoo","Lee","mllee@illinois.edu","12/09/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1517","ELECT, PHOTONICS, & MAG DEVICE","094E","Optoelectronic devices","095E","Photonic integration",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The approach will use an innovative fabrication process to address issues with Gallium Nitride-based vertical transistors that have previously limited the technology from achieving superior performance and widespread adoption. A significant amount of energy is wasted as heat due to inefficient power conversion. The solution provided through this program will reduce or eliminate the wasted energy thereby effectively extending the lifetime of available energy resources. This energy savings will add to the global energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The educational and outreach components are aimed at fostering interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines and developing scientific knowledge at the undergraduate and K-12 levels. These activities are focused on working with a diverse group of students particularly women and other underrepresented groups. Integration of the research and education will be achieved through workshops and classes dedicated to understanding semiconductor devices and build prototypes or models for their K-12 classrooms. Specific outreach goals include collaboration with K-8 girls through Engineering Adventure and Teacher College candidates through Engineers Serving Education. The educational goal is to continue building on a recently introduced coursework on power electronics and extend the knowledge on cutting edge technologies acquired through the research under this program.<br/><br/><br/>The unique polarization properties of the nitrogen polar orientation of Gallium nitride will be utilized for the first time to develop vertical transistors that require no interruptions during the growth of the structure. The reverse polarization field of the Aluminum Gallium Nitride/Gallium Nitride heterostructure is designed to block current in the transistor while providing a very conductive path for the current to flow in designated region. An on-state resistance below 1 mohm.cm2 is estimated from this novel transistor design and is set as a target in this program. Lack of an integrated gate driver has limited high switching speed and efficiency of power converters due to the deleterious effects of board interconnects and bond wire inductance. This innovation pushes the limits of power electronics to very high power densities with high efficiency delivered at high frequencies by first developing superior performance of nitride-based vertical transistors and then eliminating the limits placed on switching speed by trace inductance of bond wires and board interconnects by integrating the driver circuit based on lateral transistors on-chip. The scope of this research extends into both fundamental device research and application space where the device structures will be used to determine fundamental properties of the material including the first direct measurement of electron velocity in Gallium nitride. Finally the merit will be evident through new circuit architectures with increased efficiency and reduced form factor by enabling high efficiency power conversion at high frequencies.","12/12/2016","12/12/2016","1719219","Srabanti","Chowdhury","Srabanti.Chowdhury@asu.edu","12/12/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Davis","Davis","956186134","5307547700","OR/Sponsored Programs","United States","California","CA","1517","ELECT, PHOTONICS, & MAG DEVICE","100E","Novel devices & vacuum electronics","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jaw-muscle fiber types play an important role in fine-tuning the jaw muscles for specific motor tasks such as chewing and powerful biting. This research will study jaw-muscle fiber types across a range of primate species and use those data to test three hypotheses about the evolution of jaw muscle patterns in primates. Results of this work will provide new insights into the relationship between muscle and diet by i) increasing knowledge about the behavioral and ecological factors that shape feeding-system anatomy; ii) advancing our understanding of how jaw-muscle fiber types and whole muscle anatomy work together to generate the jaw movements and jaw forces necessary during feeding and aggressive biting; and (iii) refining models of chewing biomechanics in living and fossil primates. A central component of this work includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, including women and underrepresented minorities, in state-of-the-art methods for muscle fiber typing. In addition, results will be incorporated in community outreach programs aimed at exposing primary school girls to science. Lastly, this project will generate a unique collection of digital images and slides of muscle tissue that will be made available to the scientific community for teaching and research.<br/><br/>The jaw-closing muscles are the motors of the masticatory system. Collectively, these muscles are responsible for generating the jaw movements and forces associated with feeding behaviors as well as non-feeding oral behaviors such as aggressive biting and wide-mouth opening for canine threat display. While fiber architecture is an important determinant of whole muscle function, its functional and adaptive significance cannot be fully appreciated in the absence of information on fiber type. This lack of data on primate fiber phenotype limits 1) knowledge about variation in jaw-muscle fiber phenotype; 2) the functional significance of this variation for behavior and performance; and 3) the specificity with which we can model and test hypotheses of feeding-system function and performance in both living and fossil species. To provide a more complete framework for linking measures of primate masticatory anatomy and physiology with function and performance, the investigators will collect and analyze novel data on jaw-muscle fiber type composition and distribution in select, closely related species of strepsirrhine and anthropoid primates that diverge in a key feeding or biting behavior. The data collected will be used to: (i) quantify the myosin heavy chain (MHC) fiber type composition and distribution in primate jaw-closing muscles using state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry; (ii) test three key functional and adaptive hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the evolution of fiber phenotype in mammalian jaw muscles: the frequent recruitment hypothesis, the aggressive bite hypothesis, and the high occlusal force hypothesis; and (iii) assess the correspondence among fiber phenotype, fiber architecture and leverage with the goal of refining models of masticatory biomechanics. This project will provide novel data on the contractile proteins found in primate jaw-closing muscles, advance knowledge of the ecological and behavioral factors that drove changes in the primate jaw-muscle fiber phenotype, and yield new insights into how key components of feeding-system morphology such as fiber architecture, fiber phenotype and leverage combine to facilitate or constrain feeding behavior in primates, including species that have been advanced as models for interpreting feeding behavior and diet in early human ancestors.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1719743","Andrea","Taylor","andrea.taylor3@tu.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","Touro College","New York","100184502","6465656026","500 7th Avenue","United States","New York","NY","1392","Biological Anthropology","1392","Biological Anthropology","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently some patient populations, such as pediatrics, cannot benefit from MRI mostly due to the lack of adequate coils. Flexible and printed coils are lightweight and conform well to the human body, increasing comfort during the exam while increasing reliability, reducing the exam time due to the increased SNR obtained when coils are in close proximity to the sample. In pediatric use, the impact will be two-fold; the coils will increase the accessibility of MRI and decrease the use of general anesthesia resulting in less failed scans. The commercialization of these coils could also increase the number of MR-guided non-invasive therapy. Comfortable and inexpensive coils would assist streamline the process flow in hospitals, thus contributing to a more efficient, more affordable healthcare system.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to identify the decisive design features required in order to offer the most value to the users of flexible printed coils for MRI.

Commercially available coils use conventional, high-end expensive electronics and are designed as one-size-fits-all with heavy and bulky packaging. Printed coils are lightweight, flexible and can be manufactured at lower cost, while delivering equivalent results and in many cases better image quality than conventional coils.

Compliance with a medication regimen is defined as the extent to which patients take medications as prescribed by their health care providers. Glaucoma patients require lifelong treatment and a strict commitment to administer eye drops daily, which is especially challenging for elderly patients. The successful application of eye drops requires coordination, manual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and good vision, which result in fewer than 50 % of patients administering their eye drops as prescribed. Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals (eye drops) represent the most widely used treatment for glaucoma with more than 30 million prescriptions filled in the United States each year. This project has the potential to significantly reduce the number of patients who lose their vision due to glaucoma, dramatically improving the prognosis of those who are afflicted with this disease.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based upon the development of a drug delivery platform to guarantee patients with chronic diseases are and continue to be complaint. Chronic diseases are especially sensitive to compliance issues due to the necessity of the patient to commit to a lifetime of treatment. This will be accomplished through the use of a proprietary drug eluting, thermally-responsive polymer that is liquid at room temperature and solidifies when it heats to body temperature. A solution of the polymer loaded with a therapeutic agent will be inserted into the tear duct where it will solidify, forming a solid, liquid-permeable plug. The plug conforms perfectly to the shape of the patient?s unique anatomy due to the liquid-to-solid phase transition that occurs after insertion. Once inserted, the therapeutic agent is continuously released from the plug, maintaining drug efficacy over an extended period, eliminating the need for the application of daily eye drops and ensuring patient compliance.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1713762","Mark","Thompson","met@usc.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Southern California","Los Angeles","900890001","2137407762","University Park","United States","California","CA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This technology utilizes a new type of therapeutic agent, called ?polymer lung surfactants?. RDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs primarily in infants who are born prematurely. The cause of RDS is the lack of chemical compounds called lung surfactants in the infant?s lungs. Currently, the standard treatment for RDS involves injection of animal-derived lung surfactant compounds into the patient?s lung. However, this animal-derived treatment has major drawbacks: (1) the harvesting process carries the risk of pathogenic contamination; (2) these conventional lung surfactants (containing proteins susceptible to denaturation) require sophisticated delivery procedures that can only be practiced in locations where skilled healthcare professionals and advanced care facilities are available. Due to these factors, RDS remains a serious problem, particularly, in under-developed countries. These significant drawbacks of the current methods offers a potential opportunity for the new polymer lung surfactant technology developed here.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will develop a fully synthetic material (polymers) as a cheaper replacement for costly lipid-based formulations for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung surfactant plays a critical role in the lung?s ability to process air by lowering alveolar surface tension. For potential lung surfactant applications promising candidate materials have been identified that are capable of replicating the surface-tension-lowering properties of natural lung surfactants. The research will advance understanding of how certain polymers are able to produce extremely low air-water interfacial tensions under dynamic compression (similarly to the natural lung surfactant) and what molecular factors contribute to these behaviors.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1713953","You-Yeon","Won","yywon@ecn.purdue.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","Purdue University","West Lafayette","479072114","7654941055","Young Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a trend in the pharmaceutical industry to apply Quality by Design and PAT tools for improving pharmaceutical drug development and manufacturing. PAT is a system for designing, analyzing and controlling manufacturing using real-time measurements of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in-process materials and fabrication processes with the goal of ensuring final product quality. Successful development and application of these PAT tools can enable pharmaceutical firms to speed up the manufacturing process development, and build robustness into manufacturing processes by reducing/eliminating manufacturing errors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to develop a pharmaceutical analyzer system for use in drug development and manufacturing. The key enabling technology is an x-ray optic to generate an intensive parallel beam. By using parallel beam geometry, most of the standard sources of error in the measurements are avoided, making the measurement results more reliable. The large beam size from the optic also improves the measurement statistics in data collection. A critical innovation for this analyzer is to optimize the whole system configuration to carry out drug phase measurements by setting the detectors at fixed angles (according to the drug) rather than scanning the whole spectrum. The approach developed here enables the analyzer to continuously measure the phase of drug with very high efficiency. It would provide the information within minutes during production without complicated sample preparation.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1706634","Peter","Zavalij","pzavalij@umd.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Maryland College Park","COLLEGE PARK","207425141","3014056269","3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive","United States","Maryland","MD","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This sensor will directly benefit society by providing a new diagnostic tool that may empower users to take control of the safety of the food they consume.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will further develop a biosensor technology that functions via a synergy between conducting poly (amic) acid (PAA) and metal nanoparticles. Nano-sized nanoparticles have a high electron affinity and can strip off electrons from the surrounding PAA matrix. The technology is designed to detect the 'notorious five' pathogens namely, Salmonella, E. coli, Norovirus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria (Sensal) all within 5 minutes at 5 colonies forming unit/mL or less. Unlike enzymes, DNA or lipids, the recognition ligands are more robust and specific for the pathogen. The biosensor device is similar to a glucose strip.

The typical bandage wound dressing provides physical protection, but does not actively participate in wound healing. Additives that might actively facilitate wound healing can add prohibitive cost to an inexpensive device. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are sulfated polysaccharides that are ubiquitously present in the extracellular matrix of mammals. GAGs have been shown to facilitate wound healing, but because of the high cost of animal extraction, they are not used in low cost wound healing applications. The proposed technology utilizes sulfated cellulose as low cost GAG-mimics. The low cost of these mimics allows them to be used in bandages that will reduce healing time and reduce scaring. These GAG-mimics may also be useful in reducing the costs of more complex devices such as dermal regenerations, constructs for burn wounds, and dressings for decubitus ulcers, and diabetic wounds.<br/><br/>This I-CORPS project is based on results of research designed to investigate the use of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimics in the development of tissue engineering scaffolds as extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics for cartilage regeneration. GAGs are present in nearly every tissue in the body, and they play an important role in stabilizing important cell signaling proteins and presenting those signal molecules to cell receptors. Sulfated cellulose based GAG mimics were identified based on the similarity in molecular structure between the native GAGs and the sulfated cellulose. It was demonstrated that the biological activity of sulfated cellulose mimicked the biological activity of native GAGs.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1713688","Michael","Ehrlich","ehrlich@njit.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","New Jersey Institute of Technology","Newark","071021982","9735965275","323 DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER","United States","New Jersey","NJ","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Today many sectors, including the mortgage industry, manufacturing, healthcare, and government agencies, are using cumbersome data entry and document processing techniques. This process not only adds substantially to cost, but also increases inaccuracies in the data pool, cutting into the competitive advantage of industries and agencies. The new system eliminates traditional methods of data extraction and document classification by using a self-learning software program that gathers information from any scanned document in any paper-intensive business processes. Implementing Robotic Process Automation in data entry business processes in a structured way can accurately extract and process data much faster at a very low cost point. In addition, the proposed project plan will enhance knowledge about and research on electronic data capture systems used in healthcare, allowing the development of more efficient data-processing techniques that can improve patient care and speed up billing cycles.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will implement an effective solution that eliminates time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry. The project will provide valuable insight into the process of scanning, data capture techniques, and machine learning. The development of technical skills will also be enhanced by an innovative learning framework that explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to data capture and processing. This proprietary approach to utilizing CNNs in a non-traditional manner has led to exceptional results in identifying and extracting information from scanned documents, making it possible for the first time to fully automate paper-intensive business processes. The commercial success of such a software program is validated by the efforts several companies are making to develop a similar product themselves because currently available technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), cannot offer the level of accuracy required. This new Automated Data Capture System will also enhance research on virtual data systems for representing, querying, and automating data derivation - research that is used in applications such as virtual data language interpreters and data grids.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1712605","Mequanint","Moges","MMoges@uh.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Houston","Houston","772042015","7137435773","4800 Calhoun Boulevard","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project will identify the critical components of these systems such that the resources invested have the greatest impact in mitigating the effects of natural disasters and human attacks on infrastructure, including minimizing the potential for cascading failures across multiple systems given an event.

Specifically, a novel probabilistic framework has been developed to model the complex interdependencies between critical infrastructures. This captures the effects of events, outages, and component failures across multiple systems. It includes uncertainty modeling to perform risk and vulnerability analyses. The I-Corps technology is a generalized software tool based on this research that accounts for interdependencies, is developed for both normal operations and unexpected disruptions, and is suitable to any infrastructure system.

This industry desperately needs a tool for extraction of useful information from a large number of densely sampled sensor readings. This need is especially emphasized by the recent dramatic increases both in the number of available sensor readings, as well as the sampling rates at which those readings are collected. This tool is expected to serve a dual purpose in this industry; providing access to information to enable decision making and serve as a data reduction tool which reduces information loss. Furthermore, such a tool is expected to be useful in any industry that employs non-rotating equipment, including the oil and gas extraction, refineries, chemical process industry etc. It is expected that the volume of data gathered in many such industries will continue to increase, further motivating the need to develop and invest in such feature extraction and data reduction tools.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will focus on exploring and improving potentials of a technological innovation that will enable a fully automated extraction of informative features from signals generated by non-rotating equipment and processes. Such a tool will be able to reduce the original data into a feature set that is significantly smaller in size than the original signal, thus enabling a significantly easier data management and data mining in a large number of densely sampled sensor signals. The method in the foundation of this tool has recently been developed. It starts by segmenting the signal into a series of steady-state and transient portions, after which each segment of the data is used to construct a number of statistics-based and dynamics based signatures. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that will achieve all this with minimal or, hopefully no human involvement, in contrast to the currently used approaches, which require extensive manual inputs and analyses.","12/14/2016","12/14/2016","1712622","Dragan","Djurdjanovic","dragand@me.utexas.edu","12/14/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By monitoring electricity at the circuit level, it is possible to detect when equipment is about to malfunction. By sub-metering electricity in multi-tenant facilities, it is possible to fairly charge each occupant. By auditing energy use and benchmarking against other buildings, it is possible to identify investment opportunities that increase operating efficiency or equipment inefficiencies. All of these benefits, as well as many others, stem from greater visibility into electricity usage.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project concerns a new type of electricity sub-meter that dramatically reduces installation cost and complexity, the main impediments to greater adoption of the technology. These results are possible today because of substantial prior research into ultra-low power energy-harvesting circuits. These circuits enable self-powered sensor operation, clip-on installation that reduces installation cost and eliminates the need for electrical shutdowns, new calibration methods that can jointly calibrate the sensors and front-end electronics for better overall accuracy and lower cost, and a novel method of non-contact voltage sensing that allows true power measurement without high installation cost and safety risks of conventional voltage sensors. When the data that these new types of electricity sub-meters generate are analyzed and processed by algorithms, it is possible to identify equipment faults, allocate energy costs, detect inefficient operations, and reduce high grid demand.

Chtchelkanova","A large number of ""big data"" and ""big simulation"" applications, such as those for determining network models or simulations of partial differential equation models, concern high dimensional data that are sparse. Sparse data structures and algorithms present significant advantages in terms of storage and computational costs. However, with only a few operations per data element, efficient and scalable implementations are difficult to achieve on current and emerging high performance computing systems with very high degrees of core level parallelism, complex node interconnect topology and multicore/manycore nodes with non-uniform memory architectures (NUMA). This proposal develops and evaluates á-embedded graph hardware-software models and attendant data locality-preserving and NUMA-aware application to core/thread mappings to enhance performance and parallel scalability. <br/>Consider an application task graph A, weighted with measures of work and data sharing that is approximately embedded in two or three dimensions, to obtain an á-embedded graph A. Additionally, consider a weighted graph of a HPC system that is naturally assigned coordinates to obtain an á-embedded host graph model H. This proposal develops parallel algorithms to compute interconnect topology-aware mappings of A to H in order to optimize performance measures such as congestion and dilation while preserving load balance. Additionally, at a multicore node in H that is assigned a subgraph of A, (i) sparse data are reordered to enhance parallelism and locality, and (ii) a dynamic fine-grain NUMA-aware task scheduling is applied to respond through work-stealing to core variations in performance from resource conflicts, throttling etc. Finally, through insights gained from á-embedded graph models, sparse matrix algorithms are reformulated to enhance communication avoidance, soft error resilience and data preconditioning. Outcomes include enabling weak scaling to a very large number of cores by extracting parallelism at fine, medium and large-grains, and significantly enhanced fixed and scaled problem efficiencies through locality preservation. <br/>The interconnect topology-aware models and maps hold the potential for impact on very large scale HPC workloads through potential incorporation into the Message Passing Interface for enhanced sparse communications. Additionally, the proposed locality-aware mappings and NUMA-aware scheduling can potentially benefit the very large base of modeling and simulation applications that run on small multicore clusters. Graduate student training is enhanced through a ""scale-up"" challenge component in an interdisciplinary course on computational science and engineering. High school students are introduced to parallel computing through summer in-residence programs seeking to broaden participation in science and engineering from underrepresented communities.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1719674","Padma","Raghavan","padma.raghavan@vanderbilt.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","Vanderbilt University","Nashville","372350002","6153222631","Sponsored Programs Administratio","United States","Tennessee","TN","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING","7923","SMALL PROJECT","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the potential introduction of commercial drone applications, this technology will meet an increased need for flexible payload carrier fabrication techniques that can be customized for payload specific weight, strength, and design requirements. Additionally, the technology described in this project will provide an alternative fabrication approach for customized assistive devices that has the potential to decrease production time, lower waste and energy consumption, decrease costs, improve assistive device customization and user performance. Lastly, the ability to embed novel capabilities such as monitoring acceleration or temperature and pressure at the skin interface into these devices aligns with a growing societal interest in wearable sensors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will identify the key value propositions of a novel 3D printing technology for targeted customers and quantify the market value for devices fabricated with this technology across several application areas. Key strategic partners and major competitors within the general areas that align with this technology will be investigated. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the new knowledge that will be obtained regarding application driven needs for 3D printing of fiber reinforced polymers that enable customized fabrication of smart, functional devices. This advanced 3D printing technology reconfigures and extends the functionality of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing approach to enable 3D printing of continuous fiber composite materials along curvatures on multiple planes, including overhanging features. Preliminary results from this technology have demonstrated the first example of out-of-plane 3D printing at the meso-scale.

Industrial gas turbine production is expected to increase over the coming years and these turbines are expected to operate at much higher temperatures to achieve higher efficiencies, thereby being prone to more incidents that involve overheating. Hotspots go undetected because current thermocouple systems are generally not capable of being placed in pertinent areas and because of bulky cables that restrict placement inside gas turbines.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on wireless passive sensors that have significant impacts on a new class of sensor technology which is suitable for harsh-environment applications such as turbines, rockets, and fuel cells. This technology can provide reliable long-term sensing to increase the efficiency, improve the operational reliability and reduce the pollution for many systems. A temperature sensor using dielectric resonator structure, a low-profile reflective patch temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor based on evanescent-mode resonator structure, have been demonstrated with operation up to 1300C. These sensors are made of high-temperature-stable and corrosion-resistant Silicoboron Carbonitride (SiBCN) ceramic materials which are suitable for harsh-environment applications. The pressure sensor uses an evanescent-mode resonator structure, in which an air gap dimension decreases when the external pressure increases, causing a decrease in the resonant frequency.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1707306","Xun","Gong","xun.gong@ucf.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Central Florida","ORLANDO","328168005","4078230387","4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD","United States","Florida","FL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, results from this study will provide first-order controls on arc magma petrogenesis, connecting the mantle source and melting process with the crustal plumbing system as well as provide insights on the aggregation of mantle-derived melts beneath arc volcanoes. The project is designed to use an integrative approach combining constraints from geochemistry, seismology, and fluid dynamics. The project will lead to a better understanding of magma transport beneath active volcanoes and improve our interpretation of monitoring dataset from such volcanoes.<br/><br/>Current models for magma transport in convergent margins suggest the prolonged storage and evolution of mantle-derived melts in the crust. This project will test whether a fast mode of magma transport even for large, long-lived arc magma systems exists and what conditions may facilitate such rapid ascent from the mantle to the surface. The time-integrative nature of geochemical data often precludes a direct comparison to geophysical signals that record transient processes. However, geochemical speedometers employing fast elemental diffusion in zoned magmatic crystals may bridge this observational gap and advance the application of geochemical tools to short time scale magmatic processes otherwise only investigated through geophysics. Such techniques have been successfully employed for near-surface magmatic processes; this projects aims at extending such approaches to the entire crustal magma ascent path.","12/15/2016","01/30/2017","1719687","Philipp","Ruprecht","pruprecht@unr.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno","Reno","895570001","7757844040","1664 North Virginia Street","United States","Nevada","NV","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Edgerton","This project is focused on the development and testing of a new instrument for measuring atmospheric concentrations of peroxy radicals in the atmosphere. The new method will use a novel acetaldehyde/nitric oxide chemical amplification approach to greatly improve upon the traditional chemical amplification technique that uses carbon monoxide (CO) for measuring peroxy radicals. A prototype version of the instrument has been developed and successfully tested it in the laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Peroxy radicals are important because they react with nitric oxide in the atmosphere to form ozone, a potent greenhouse gas and an air pollutant with adverse health and ecological impacts on humans and plants.<br/><br/>The acetaldehyde-based amplification factor is predicted to be relatively stable and is not expected to vary significantly with relative humidity, as does the CO factor. The method also will enable the peroxy radicals to be speciated due to differences in wall loss rates resulting from the addition of a sampling scrubber made of a material that is much more reactive to the hydroperoxy radical (HO2) than to RO2 (peroxy radical where R is an organic substituent). Several candidate materials have been identified and will be thoroughly investigated in the project. Prior to field-testing, the instrument will be tested for interferences by peroxyacetyl nitrate, nitrate radical, and other possible interferents and calibrated using multiple calibration sources to provide confidence that the measurements are not compromised by systematic errors associated with any particular calibration method. <br/><br/>A preliminary field test will be conducted in outdoor air in Amherst over a period of a week or more, with periodic automated standard additions of nitrogen dioxide and HO2. Deployments of the new instrument will take place during the summers of 2015 to 2017 at forest sites that with different environmental conditions, such as differences in nitrogen oxide concentrations and/or types of emissions of biogenic volatile organic hydrocarbons. During these deployments, several other scientific teams will bring their instruments to participate in an intercomparison of peroxy radical measurement methods.

Initiated in 2004, MPOWIR activities started in earnest in 2007. The objectives of the program, as determined by the community in the 2005 planning workshop are: (1) to provide continuity of mentoring from a young woman's graduate career, through her postdoctoral years to the first years of her permanent job, (2) to establish a collective responsibility within the physical oceanography community for the mentoring of junior women in the field, (3) to provide a variety of mentoring resources and mentors on a variety of issues, (4) to cast a wide net to avoid exclusiveness and (5) to open this mentoring program to all those who self-identify as a physical oceanographer. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The MPOWIR program, through its focus on the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography, will allow further capitalization on the investment the funding agencies and universities have made on the education of women students. Essentially, this project seeks to stem the loss of intellectual capital for the physical oceanographic field, as well as other geoscience disciplines through the following activities:<br/><br/>1.Pattullo conference: This biannual conference brings together about 25 junior women physical oceanographers, together with 12 senior physical oceanographers, both male and female, for a 2.5 day meeting focused on discipline-based mentoring.<br/>2.Mentoring groups: Groups of about 6 junior women and 2 senior women physical oceanographers meet for a monthly teleconference, for the purpose of confidential, personalized mentoring.<br/>3.MPOWIR website: The website serves as a repository of resources for mentoring and physical oceanography careers.<br/>4.Databases and surveys: Regular surveys are conducted to assess the effectiveness of MPOWIR activities, determine community mentoring needs, and evaluate progress in retention.<br/>5.Town Hall meetings and socials: Events at the Ocean Sciences meeting facilitate networking between physical oceanographers and provide career development information to junior scientists. <br/><br/>The website and town hall meetings are open to all, and greater emphasis will be placed on making material available via the website, to ensure a gender-neutral benefit. Efforts to export the MPOWIR model to other disciplines and institutions will be undertaken via links with the Earth Science Women's Network, and through a new quarterly newsletter. Social media will be used to publicize MPOWIR activities, announcement and events.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposed work aids efforts to create a scientific workforce whose diversity more closely matches that of the student population and that of the U.S. population as a whole, by aiding the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography and other geoscience disciplines.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1719821","Colleen","Mouw","cmouw@uri.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Rhode Island","KINGSTON","028811967","4018742635","RESEARCH OFFICE","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1610","PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The application of the research specifically is to study with high temporal resolution the evolution of the white-light morphology of the artificial radio-induced aurora. Ownership of the HAARP facility was transferred from the US Air Force to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in August, 2015. During campaigns, significant expenditures for fuel and personnel are required. Large start-up costs make HAARP experiments largely inaccessible to individual researchers unless multiple experiments and funding sources can be bundled together during a campaign of up to two-week duration. Based on recent pledged support from sponsors, UAF plans to conduct a limited experiment campaign in February 2017; this schedule is unflexible and consequently, the RAPID management of the award would enable the schedule to be enhanced with additional experiments thus utilizing the HAARP facility more effectively. Broader impacts will be maximized by encouraging public participation in various roles.<br/><br/>This project is a singular opportunity for researchers to conduct ionosphere modification experiments by taking advantage of efficiencies gained through bundling onto the campaign already planned for February. The primary experimental objective of this project is to measure time-dependent artificial airglow or ""aurora"" morphology with a sensitive white-light video camera capable of 30 frames per second temporal resolution. The secondary experimental objective is to test Arctic HF radio propagation paths using community and amateur radio (ham) participation. Both experiment objectives are highly relevant to active areas of space physics and Arctic radio communications research. Ionosphere radio modification is an important experimental technique for investigating: 1) plasma processes difficult or impossible to replicate in a laboratory, 2) the near-earth space environment, 3) radio propagation properties, and 4) natural processes such as aurora that transfer energy into the upper atmosphere. The primary and secondary objectives are 1) to measure the white-light artificial aurora morphology with high temporal resolution and 2) to test possible HF radio propagation paths in the Arctic. Both experiment objectives align with formerly active areas of research at HAARP prior to the suspension of operations.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1702328","Christopher","Fallen","ctfallen@alaska.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus","Fairbanks","997757880","9074747301","West Ridge Research Bldg 008","United States","Alaska","AK","4202","UPPER ATMOSPHERIC FACILITIES","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1521",NA,NA,NA,"AERONOMY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) enabled research will include 1) a better understanding of the climate feedbacks internal to the Earth System that drove ice ages to switch from a 41-kyr periodicity to the irregular 110-kyr periodicity seen today, 2) constraints on future sea level rise from the heat flow and bed material property information obtained, 3) creation of a new interdisciplinary style of Antarctic ""Subglacial System Science"" that fosters across-discipline synergies, and 4) entrainment of young researchers in polar science via the excitement of discovery of the largely unknown ice sheet interior. The RAID Science Planning Workshop will provide a venue to: 1) bring diverse scientists together to explore science questions and approaches; 2) define science goals to be addressed by the drill; 3) seek synergies between different disciplines interested in the Rapid Access; 4) develop a coherent science plan for the use of the drill; 5) set priorities between the science targets; and 6) engage early-career and underrepresented researchers. The workshop will provide support for a two-day conference with a total attendance of about 60 members of the Antarctic glacial- and subglacial-science communities. The support provided by NSF will cover partial travel costs for 20 key US participants and full travel costs for 12 early-career researchers.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1719246","Jeffrey","Severinghaus","jseveringhaus@ucsd.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography","LA JOLLA","920930210","8585341293","8602 La Jolla Shores Dr","United States","California","CA","1647","ANTARCTIC INSTRUM & SUPPORT","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5112","5116","5292",NA,"ANTARCTIC EARTH SCIENCES","ANTARCTIC GLACIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ANTARCTIC INTEGRATED SYS SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Szekely","High dimensional statistical problems are prevalent in the environmental sciences, particularly in soil, atmospheric, and oceanic data applications. In these cases the processes of interest are inherently nonlinear and dynamic. Different sources of information for these systems include spatial observational data as well as physics and chemistry based numerical models. Over the past decade there has been an increase in the amount of available real-time geographic information as well as advances in the sophistication and resolution of deterministic atmospheric and oceanic models. A broad class of spatial-temporal models is developed for multivariate processes on Euclidean spaces and the sphere to explain the variability and the cross-dependency between different variables. This general class of models goes beyond standard assumptions, in particular of stationarity. The properties of the proposed methods, as well as the asymptotic properties of the estimates are studied. Likelihood approximation methods for massive spatial data are presented to efficiently implement the proposed statistical models. The proposed framework and models are used to better model soil pollution, air pollution, and wind fields. These high spatial resolution wind fields are used to predict energy production from windmills, they are also the primary forcing for numerical forecasts of the coastal ocean response to force winds such as the height of the storm surge and the degree of coastal flooding. The goal is to obtain more accurate estimation of wind fields over land and water to improve the quality of storm surge forecasts, and wind energy.<br/><br/>The most important scientific contributions of this research project are: the introduction of flexible spatial models on the sphere for prediction and estimation of environmental spatial processes observed over larger regions on the Earth's surface; methods for likelihood approximation of big spatial temporal lattice data in general situations; general and flexible models for spatial prediction of multivariate environmental processes on spatial lattices, introducing the concept of conditional correlation in spatial lattice models; and advanced methods for spatial prediction and estimation in the presence of massive data from observations and physical and chemistry models. In these cases the processes of interest are inherently nonlinear and dynamic. Different sources of information for these systems include observational data as well as physics-based numerical models. Over the past decade there has been an increase in the amount of available real-time observations as well as advances in the sophistication and resolution of deterministic chemistry, atmospheric and oceanic models. Our methodology will provide more accurate representation and prediction of the underlying space-time process of interest. Through our collaborative work, we will help the enhancement of science by implementing these methods to hurricane wind fields and to weather and air and soil pollution to improve weather and air/soil quality mapping. The investigators will disseminate broadly the methods proposed here to enhance mathematical and scientific understanding. The PI will offer short courses in Spanish in Hispanic countries to broaden the participation of underrepresented geographic and ethnic groups. A course in advanced spatial statistics methods will be taught by the PI, and the new statistical methods proposed here will be introduced to the students.

Airborne networking is important because of the growing complexity of the National Airspace System with the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This project develops an innovative new theoretical framework for cyber-physical systems (CPS) to enable airborne networking, which utilizes direct flight-to-to-flight communication for flexible information sharing, safe maneuvering, and coordination of time-critical missions.<br/><br/>This project uses an innovative co-design approach that exploits the mutual benefits of networking and decentralized mobility control in an uncertain heterogeneous environment. The approach departs from the usual perspective that views physical mobility as communication constraints, communication as constraints for decentralized mobility control, and uncertain environment as constraints for both. Instead, approach taken here proactively exploits the constraints, uncertainty, and new structures with information to enable high-performance designs. The features of the co-design such as scalability, fast response, trackability, and robustness to uncertainty advance the core CPS science on decision-making for large-scale networks under uncertainty. <br/><br/>The technological advances developed in this research will contribute to multiple fields, including mobile networking, decentralized control, experiment design, and general real-time decision making under uncertainty for CPS. Technology transfer will be pursued through close collaboration with industries and national laboratories. This novel research direction will also serve as a unique backdrop to inspire the CPS workforce. New teaching materials will benefit the future CPS workforce by equipping them with a knowledge base in networking and control. Broad outreach and dissemination activities that involve undergraduate student societies, K-12 school teaching, and public events, all stemming from the PI's current efforts, will be enhanced.","12/15/2016","12/15/2016","1714519","Yan","Wan","yan.wan@uta.edu","12/15/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Arlington","Arlington","760190145","8172722105","1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT","United States","Texas","TX","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Vibrational control offers unique capabilities for controlling unstable systems without the need for feedback. Consider an upside-down pendulum with a movable base. By measuring the pendulum position, a control system can command side-to-side movement of the base in order to keep it upright. But if position measurements are not available, the pendulum will topple over. Similarly, a person may balance a broomstick on their hand by watching it move. However, if that person were made to wear a blindfold and thick gloves, the task would be impossible. Using vibrational control allows the upside-down pendulum to be kept balanced with no feedback, by moving the base up and down at the right frequency and amplitude. There are no other known methods to accomplish this. Many important applications could benefit from a systematic application of vibrational control, including chemical reactions, material processing, and flexible structures. However the only currently developed tool for vibrational control -- a mathematical technique called first-order averaging -- is very poorly suited to engineering design. Therefore this project will explore three promising alternatives.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to explore and resolve competing approaches to the analysis and design of vibrational control systems. Vibrational control has the potential to fundamentally transform control applications characterized by underlying instability, limited processing speed, high degrees of freedom, limited actuation, and little or no sensing. First-order averaging is the mathematical technique currently used almost exclusively to analyze and design vibrational controllers. This project considers three promising alternatives to first-order averaging, namely higher-order averaging using power series, higher-order averaging using Volterra series (the ""chronological calculus""), and stability maps based on Floquet theory. This project will resolve discrepancies between these approaches, and derive the fundamental benefits and drawbacks of each. The results of this project will change vibrational control from a mathematical curiosity to a powerful and practical engineering tool. The project includes validation on models of flapping-wing micro air vehicles, and ion confinement and filtering.","12/16/2016","12/16/2016","1709746","Haithem","Taha","hetaha@uci.edu","12/16/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","7569","Dynamics, Control and System D","030E","CONTROL SYSTEMS","034E","Dynamical systems","7916","EAGER","8024","Complex Systems",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Strengthening community resilience to natural disasters depends critically on improving construction practices across a private sector dominated by low-rise buildings. This issue becomes particularly urgent for coastal communities, where hurricane risk is escalating under changing sea levels and climate conditions. Historically, masonry load bearing wall systems had served as a trusted mode of low-rise construction in such settings. For example, builders in the southeastern United States commonly use masonry for churches, schools, commercial buildings, and even residences. Despite their popularity, the vulnerabilities in these systems to natural hazards can be significant, particularly within states that have yet to enact statewide minimum building standards. Regrettably, these vulnerabilities are only revealed under extreme wind, wave, and storm surge loads associated with the passage of major hurricanes. This makes the forensic analysis of building failures during major hurricanes a critical source of knowledge to improve the design state-of-the-art. <br/><br/>The passage of Hurricane Matthew over Haiti in October 2016 provides an opportunity to conduct a forensic analysis of low-rise masonry building performance under one of the most significant hurricanes in recent history. This setting includes construction preferences that facilitate unique comparative analyses of variables known to influence performance of masonry buildings under wind, wave, and storm surge. Moreover, the fact that portions of Haiti have recently undergone reconstruction, following the devastating January 2010 earthquake in that country, with greater vigilance toward seismic detailing, furthers the potential for impact, as there has been no prior opportunity in the United States to explore the in-situ performance of structures under multiple significant hazards in a limited time period (strong earthquake followed by major hurricane). Through a combination of aerial and ground-based techniques, the multi-institutional team will collect perishable data to answer the following questions: (1) How did traditional masonry structural systems perform under hurricane wind, wave, and storm surge? (2) How did the new structural systems that have emerged in response to the 2010 earthquake and aseismically detailed traditional masonry systems perform in this major hurricane? (3) How does the performance of traditional masonry load bearing walls in Hurricane Matthew compare to that observed in the 2010 earthquake? How can this inform future multi-hazard designs? These insights will contribute to advancing more resilient, multi-hazard construction practices to reduce future losses of life and property.","12/16/2016","12/16/2016","1709357","David","Prevatt","dprev@ce.ufl.edu","12/16/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Notre Dame","NOTRE DAME","465565708","5746317432","940 Grace Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","014Y","Engineering for Natural Hazard","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","039E","STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS","040E","Haz mitigation of structural sys","043E","EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","1576","NATIONL EARTHQK HZRD REDCT PRG","Tracy","Kijewski-Correa","tkijewsk@nd.edu","12/16/2016","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrew","Kennedy","Andrew.B.Kennedy.117@nd.edu","12/16/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","Alexandros","Taflanidis","Alexandros.A.Taflanidis.1@nd.edu","12/16/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,"7914","RAPID","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This event and the investigator's previous research and sampling in the region presents a rare opportunity to study erosion associated with widespread landslides that occur at the same time as major earthquakes. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will examine the erosion associated with these landslides using modern geological techniques. It will enhance international collaboration between the US and New Zealand and involve three graduate students in the scientific research process. The project is led by an early career female investigator.<br/><br/>This project will address the following questions of relevance to the geomorphology and geochronology communities: 1) What effect does coseismic landsliding have on detrital cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) derived basin wide erosion rates? and 2) What is the contribution of periodic but widespread coseismic landslides to erosional mass flux in tectonically active mountain belts such as the Kaikoura Ranges? The principal investigator and her team will address these questions by doing repeat detrital 10Be CRN measurements in six drainages shaken by the earthquake. These samples will be used to examine basin-wide erosion rates following extensive coseismic landsliding. Landsliding is predicted to complicate detrital CRN measurements of basin wide erosion rates. This study will circumvent this complication by constraining erosion rates before (with previously collected samples) and directly following a large earthquake (to be sampled this January 2017).","12/19/2016","12/19/2016","1719622","Alison","Duvall","aduvall@uw.edu","12/19/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","7298","COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH","5941","NEW ZEALAND","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7458","7571",NA,NA,"GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM","DEEP EARTH PROCESSES SECTION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, an improved understanding of these processes are essential for the understanding of the origin and development of the Earth and for mitigation of natural hazards. At the present time, however, only the shallowest part of the Earth can be observed directly using cores from drill holes; consequently, an array of computing-intensive geophysical techniques are applied to image the active planet. Those techniques are similar to those used in the hospital to image the human body.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Shear-wave splitting is a fundamental geophysical observation that uniquely indicates the presence of azimuthal anisotropy along the ray path. Such anisotropy is the result of dynamic processes in the Earth's asthenosphere and lithosphere. However, dynamic interpretation of shear-wave splitting requires homogeneous, high quality measurements, and quantitative forward models. This project will measure shear-wave splitting parameters at all of the USArray Transportable Array and other broadband seismic stations in the eastern U.S. and update measurements throughout the North American plate. The data product includes ~10,000 shear-wave splitting measurements that we are merging with ~16,000 measurements that we produced for the western and central U.S. with NSF prior funding via EarthScope. We are utilizing a set of procedures for reliably measuring and ranking the splitting parameters for producing a uniform database, quantifying shear-wave splitting complexity and likely depth of anisotropy along the way. To complement this reference shear-wave splitting database, we are computing a large number of geodynamic forward models of synthetic shear-wave splitting and anisotropic structure for surface wave studies by computing fabrics from mantle flow and simplified tectonic models. This way, we can test which hypotheses for the origin of anisotropy can be reliably discerned, which tectonic scenarios best reflect observations, and how to guide regional refinement of our understanding of continental and upper mantle structure and dynamics. Using this joint approach, we are addressing a number of significant questions regarding the origin of seismic anisotropy, including lithospheric inheritance and recent asthenospheric flow, and the nature of mantle convection underneath the North American plate. In addition, all our measurements, as well as synthetic waveforms, are being openly shared so as to allow others to refine their resulting reference models; this ensures our data product will have a significant impact on a broad range of Earth science questions.","12/19/2016","12/19/2016","1719204","Thorsten","Becker","twb@ig.utexas.edu","12/19/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","017F","EARTHSCOPE-SCIENCE UTILIZATION","017F","EARTHSCOPE-SCIENCE UTILIZATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research project seeks to understand and advance the role of new additive manufacturing technologies (commonly referred to as ""3D printing"") in the design and prototyping of textile products. The PIs' goal is to develop 3D printing hardware and computer software that enable engineers to prototype textile designs more quickly and economically, and with greater control over a broad gamut of mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics such as aerodynamic drag, adhesion, heat regulation, friction, elasticity, porosity, density, electrical conductivity, and visual appearance. Beyond individual textiles, project outcomes will support the fabrication of complete products that do not require considerable stitching and assembly, and which may include curved shapes too difficult to cut from flat panels and/or complex composite assemblies too costly to fabricate via traditional methods. To achieve these objectives, the PIs will develop: a library of highly-optimized textile ""units"" that can be combined using a new language of textile functionality to form a vast array of possible textiles; computer optimization software that enables precise control of textile properties; a computer program that allows users to visually and interactively design complex textile products; and a specialized 3D Printer that is able to precisely fabricate textiles involving multiple materials.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this project will create the first complete hardware/software pipeline for digital design and fabrication of textiles using multi-material 3D printing. The first fundamental step in this pipeline is constructing parameterized meta-material templates that provide users with high-level knobs for tuning the behavior and large-scale properties of a textile. Next, the ability to interactively simulate the behavior of a virtual textile will be achieved by combining continuum homogenization and data-driven methods; the PIs will develop an interactive design tool that employs first order sensitivity analysis tied to the physical simulation, to enable designers to navigate the huge space of possible designs at both the micro and macro levels. A new language for functionally specifying textile designs that employs a reducer-tuner model will allow engineers and designers to specify meta-materials in terms of desired behavior and performance, enabling designs with guarantees on their characteristics and compliance with standards. Printing volumes for current 3D printers are limited; however, by incorporating computational textile folding into the pipeline, the PIs' system will be able to print very large designs in much smaller folded configurations. Solution of the folding problem will involve nonlinear, non-convex, optimization with unilateral contact constraints. Finally, textiles and garments will be printed using both off-the-shelf 3D printers and a novel low-cost, high-resolution, modular 3D printing platform that is capable of printing with up to 12 different materials that vary in mechanical and appearance properties. In addition to photopolymer materials, the PIs plan to extend hardware capabilities to 3D print structures using co-polymers and solvent-based materials.

Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics. In this project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is, various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies. The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras. We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory. Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics. A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense. An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose. An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense. Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century. In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms.","12/20/2016","12/20/2016","1708802","Isaac","Goldbring","isaac@math.uic.edu","12/20/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","1268","FOUNDATIONS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8048",NA,NA,NA,"Division Co-Funding: CAREER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the engineering nature of the discipline, one of the best ways to study software engineering principles is to apply them in active learning contexts, such as case studies or hands-on exercises. When teaching undergraduates, it is crucial to make a clear connection between these learning contexts and related theoretical material, while designing active learning activities in a way that students would find easy to relate to.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and establish the effectiveness of using kinesthetic learning modules leveraging LEGO as a tangible manipulative to improve student learning and engagement in undergraduate software engineering education.

Yellen","Under the direction of Dr. Daniela Triadan, Melissa Burham will investigate the social and spatial organization of ancient Maya cities through time. Many scholars have focused on evidence from the center of Maya cities, households and settlement patterns to understand social and political organization. However, in complex, urbanized societies, social groups such as neighborhoods, districts and local communities, develop at levels between the household, the city, and the state. These were important spheres of social reproduction and negotiation both in the past and present, and help to unify different groups of people into cohesive social, economic and political systems. Archaeology is well placed to study how diverse groups formed in the past, and how they articulated with the larger society through time. Burham's project contributes to a growing body of research on intermediate-level groups by focusing on the interactions that fostered local identities, which may have included ritual practices, co-residence, and the management of communal resources, like water. By looking at developments over a time span of almost 2000 years, this project investigates the nature of early urbanization and explores how early complexity shaped later society. Furthermore, by studying the role of water management in social integration, this project carries implications for understanding sustainability and resource management in urban landscapes, both past and present. Burham's work provides methodological and theoretical approaches for studying different levels of community organization, and hence offers new insights into the development of urbanism and social complexity in ancient societies. <br/><br/>Burham's research is part of the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project, which consists of an international team of collaborators directed by Dr. Takeshi Inomata and Dr. Daniela Triadan. Ceibal, located in Guatemala, had an extensive occupation from the Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic periods (ca. 1000 BC-AD 900), and appears to have had a well-structured city plan. It is therefore an ideal case to study the spatial and social organization of people living in outlying areas through time. Burham's project focuses on minor temple groups, which are located at regular intervals in outlying residential areas. Many researchers have suggested minor temples were important integrative hubs in lowland Maya settlements. Building on these perspectives, this project investigates minor ceremonial groups, how the people living near them related to the temples and to each other, and how the practices and social relations undertaken at the temples influenced the larger sociopolitical order. Minor temples were likely the physical and ideological centers of local communities at Ceibal. Although they may have been discrete social units, the formation of these groups was crucial to shaping and sustaining the larger society, especially as populations increased and social hierarchies became more pronounced. Focusing on evidence from five minor temple complexes and the residential structures surrounding them, this project assesses the degree and nature of social integration of local communities by examining whether they were: 1) arranged into spatially-distinct zones and organized in association with at least one temple; 2) had a source of water within each zone that supported the local community population; and 3) had a distinct pattern of material culture within each zone, resulting from similar access to or preferences for certain goods. An examination of multiple lines of evidence over a large time span provides a basis to better understand the formation of intermediate social groups, and for exploring how community organization may have changed throughout Ceibal's history.","12/20/2016","12/20/2016","1700734","Daniela","Triadan","dtriadan@u.arizona.edu","12/20/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Arizona","Tucson","857194824","5206266000","888 N Euclid Ave","United States","Arizona","AZ","7606","DDRI Archaeology","1391","ARCHAEOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Melissa","Burham","meliss10@email.arizona.edu","12/20/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At its core lie elementary questions that might excite a high school student as much as an expert. For example, imagine that one colors the edges and diagonals of an icosahedron red or blue. Can one always find a triangle whose edges are all red or a triangle whose edges are all blue? While combinatorics has traditionally found applications in computer science, information theory, and mathematical models, this project aims to further investigate its applications to what must be the oldest part of mathematics: number theory. The PI will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the project. The problems under study are suitable for training in research as they are easily accessible and offer an excellent setting for grasping some of the core techniques used in combinatorics. Parallel to and supported by the research activities of the project, the PI's goal is to write a short book on the application of combinatorics to number theory aimed at undergraduates in mathematics. <br/><br/>Inverse theorems have catalyzed the development of additive combinatorics in recent years. However, some very basic inverse questions remain largely untouched. This project focuses on the study of open questions where combinatorial methods are likely to be of use. Three indicative examples, which are easy to formulate and hence will reach a wide mathematical audience, are: what structural information can be derived for finite sets in a commutative group that have near maximum number of h-fold sums; what can be said about finite sets of integers whose exponential sum has nearly minimum norm; and what can be deduced about the number of distinct differences that are formed from pairs of elements of a finite set, when the number of distinct sums is known? It is hoped that a combination of recent advances in the field and novel ideas will lead to progress. As these questions are representative of the challenges one must overcome in a wider variety of cardinality questions in additive combinatorics. It is hoped that any discoveries will be applied to other contexts as well. The project's methodology has a strong interdisciplinary component, which could unearth new connections between combinatorics and harmonic analysis.","12/20/2016","12/20/2016","1723016","Georgios","Petridis","giorgis.petridis@gmail.com","12/20/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","ATHENS","306021589","7065425939","310 East Campus Rd","United States","Georgia","GA","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing techniques, based primarily on checkpoint and replay, are no longer effective for emerging systems with orders-of-magnitude more hardware and software components. This project aims to overcome the main limitation of existing techniques: the detection and mitigation of silent errors by developing and leveraging automated software analysis and synthesis techniques.<br/>The new methods under development can compile a tunable degree of resilience into the application software code, and have potential to transform the development of future generations of HPC applications. By treating the software code as white-boxes, as opposed to black-boxes, these new methods can provide significantly more economical solutions to the HPC resilience problem compared to existing techniques. The project will help realize the US NRC's vision of conducting exascale science, which is crucial for addressing the nation?s urgent needs in frontiers such as new energy, health care, and national security.<br/>This project develops automated program analysis techniques for identifying invariants from software code, and leveraging these invariants to detect and mitigate silent errors at run time. By treating the application software code as white-boxes, it seeks to generate invariants that capture the expected program behavior. By leveraging the invariants as correctness conditions, it overcomes the major hurdle in detecting silent errors, which is the lack of visible symptoms. In addition to detecting errors, the invariants are also used by runtime monitors to intelligently perturb the execution order or memory state to proactively avoid failures at run time. When the rollback recovery becomes inevitable, the invariants are used as guidance to minimize the re-execution overhead.<br/>The proposed methods and software tools are evaluated on real applications from the research community as well as sources such as SciDAC.","12/20/2016","12/20/2016","1722710","Chao","Wang","wang626@usc.edu","12/20/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Southern California","Los Angeles","900890001","2137407762","University Park","United States","California","CA","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7923","SMALL PROJECT","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Isolation, the lack of role models and access to resources contribute as well. <br/><br/>The proposed project strives to increase the participation of students with visual impairments through better preparation and support. The overall goals are to increase access to an established curriculum (Exploring Computer Science) and success within the area of computing for students with visual impairments at the high school level. The development of programming tools and online modules will provide access where gaps exist in current software. The project team will assess the degree to which original Exploring Computer Science (ECS) can be made accessible to high school students who are visually impaired. The comparison in student achievement and attitudes about Computer Science will also be conducted between students using the ECS curriculum and those using the I-ECS curriculum in order to evaluate the similarity of the two curricula. By design, the I-ECS project intends to increase participation in computing by individuals with visual impairments at all socioeconomic levels via student and educator support. The project will involve students, parents and educators from around the nation. <br/><br/>The structured approach, building on the foundation of an existing high school computer science curriculum, will enable those with visual impairments to have greater access to the diverse areas of computer science through face-to-face and online resources that foster continuous learning and community, as the means to transition to college degrees in computing. The project components are designed to promote growth by all participants, including parents. The online community will foster greater accommodation of visually impaired students in the computer science classroom. Assessment will provide much needed statistical analysis of both the challenges and successes of students who are visually impaired.","12/21/2016","03/07/2017","1709100","Stephanie","Ludi","stephanie.ludi@unt.edu","12/21/2016","Principal Investigator","University of North Texas","DENTON","762035017","9405653940","1155 Union Circle #305250","United States","Texas","TX","7382","Computing Ed for 21st Century","7579","Broadening Participation (BP)","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1714",NA,NA,NA,"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fisher","Many companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon) put huge capital investments into building larger data center networks with higher link speeds. It becomes increasingly important to carefully manage such large data center networks to support multiple tenants, meet service level agreements of applications, and reduce operation cost. Most network management tasks, such as traffic accounting, traffic engineering, load balancing, and performance diagnosis, rely on accurate and timely measurement of time-varying traffic across the entire network. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are three key problems in today's measurement support: (1) Network device vendors often treat measurement as a second-class citizen, devoting most of the resources to meet the networking control functions (forwarding, firewalls, load balancing, etc.), leaving limited resources for supporting measurement. (2) Operators have limited control over what (not) to measure and when to measure. As a result, the already limited measurement resources are sometimes wasted to measure flows that operators do not care, leaving even fewer resources for measuring important flows. (3) These solutions are device oriented instead of network wide. Operators have to dive into the limited measurement support at multiple devices, taking great efforts to understand these measurement results offline, and find it challenging to answer their network-wide queries.<br/><br/>This project aims to design and build a programmable measurement architecture MAP, which transforms today's network measurement practice in enterprise and data center networks. Inspired by software-defined networking, MAP allows operators to flexibly program their network-wide measurement queries in a controller. To answer these queries, MAP automatically configures and coordinates new measurement primitives at different places across the network stack. MAP also allows operators to dynamically change their queries and automatically reconfigure the primitives accordingly to handle network dynamics.<br/><br/>There are three key research directions: First, the project will bring novel measurement algorithms and designs throughout the network stack (VMs, hypervisors, switches, and packet sniffers). The researcher will redesign the measurement primitives at these devices to make them both generic in supporting diverse measurement requirements, and efficient in packet processing performance with limited resources and capabilities. Second, the researcher will design new declarative measurement abstractions for operators to clearly express what to measure at the network level and their accuracy/timeliness requirements. The researcher will also design and implement a runtime system that automatically matches the measurement abstractions with primitives at devices, dynamically allocates resources across tasks and handles network dynamics such as mobile hosts and routing changes. Finally, the researcher will study how to support several important and novel measurement tasks with MAP?s primitives, abstractions, and runtime, and evaluate them on MAP. <br/><br/>The proposed research, if successful, will fundamentally change network measurement and management practice in enterprise and data centers, and lead to new designs of network devices. The research will facilitate inter-discipline research between theory, programming languages, and networking. The project also has a significant education component, including the design and innovations of graduate courses and course material on software-defined networking and computer networking, as well as research experiences for undergraduate students and members of under-represented groups.","12/21/2016","12/21/2016","1701754","Minlan","Yu","minlan.yu@yale.edu","12/21/2016","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Glinert","This is funding to support participation by approximately 12 U.S.-based doctoral students (out of an estimated 21 total participants) who have completed their dissertation proposals. along with distinguished faculty mentors, in a doctoral colloquium (workshop) on information science research to be held in conjunction with the twelfth iConference that will take place March 22-25, 2017, in Wuhan, China, and which will be the first iConference in Asia. Since 2005, the iConferences have provided a forum where information scholars, researchers and professionals from around the world gather to share insights on critical information issues in contemporary society. An openness to new ideas and research fields in information science is a primary characteristics of these events, which have been successful in bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, thereby helping to promote interdisciplinary research. Recent iConferences have drawn approximately 500 attendees, a testament to participants' appreciation for the inspiring sense of community, high quality research presentations, and myriad opportunities for engagement. The iConferences are presented by the iCaucus, now a consortium of 77 Information Schools in the United States and abroad dedicated to advancing the information field and preparing students to meet the information challenges of the 21st Century. This year's theme is ""Effect, Expand, Evolve: Global collaboration across the Information Community""; more information may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference. The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers focused on the interplay of information and technology in a social context, allowing them to develop a network both among themselves and with senior researchers. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field. The organizers of the 2017 event will proactively work to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topic, methodological approach, disciplinary tradition, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural background, so that the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. Based on past experience, the organizers expect a majority of the 21 accepted students will be women, but at a minimum will ensure that at least 10 of them are. Furthermore, no more than 4 students will be accepted from any single university.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Colloquium will be tightly integrated into the conference experience, starting with an orientation event highlighting specific content during the technical program, and culminating in a full day focused on peer-research critique and career development which will overlap with and immediately follow the closing session of the conference technical program on March 25. The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results in order to gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research. The student participants will come away with a better understanding of the various research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the field. In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities such as poster sessions to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions, and it will also help them successfully launch their careers whether in industry or academia.","12/21/2016","12/21/2016","1713738","Kevin","Crowston","crowston@syr.edu","12/21/2016","Principal Investigator","Syracuse University","SYRACUSE","132441200","3154432807","OFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS","United States","New York","NY","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many regions experience shortages or constraints in delivery of these resources (short and long-term) with appreciable costs for individual consumers as well as society at large. Technology that brings high-resolution consumption data in real-time to consumers allows them to understand the price and effect of individual choices as well as the benefits to be gained by decisions to reduce, defer, and schedule consumption. Clear economic incentives exist at this consumer level that will generate 'bottom-up' benefits for society as a whole through more efficient infrastructure and resources use.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Cyber Physical Systems project explores commercialization potential and conducts customer discovery for technology to analyze and communicate end-user utility consumption and effects on large-scale utility infrastructure systems. This technology capitalizes on the advent of Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which allows real-time monitoring and communication of water and other utility consumption and behavior. It is comprised of a suite of information technology components for capture, assessment, and presentation of data through multiple channels, algorithms to analyze usage patterns, and additional algorithms to translate consumption patterns for system operations and infrastructure optimization needs. A pilot study implementing this technology at a water utility has found significant reductions in water usage, leading to lower customer costs; at the same time, the utility reports higher customer satisfaction. Advanced metering infrastructure represents a ubiquitous sensing technology, a class crucial to 'smart' infrastructures and cyber-physical systems.","12/21/2016","12/21/2016","1700072","James","Brumbelow","kbrumbelow@civil.tamu.edu","12/21/2016","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station","College Station","778454645","9798477635","TEES State Headquarters Bldg.","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Glinert","This is funding to support a ""Think Tank"" (workshop) of about 13 promising graduate student scholars along with distinguished research faculty mentors, in conjunction with the 23rd Annual International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2017), which will be held June 20-23 on the University Park campus of Pennsylvania State University. ICAD is the premier international forum for presenting research on the use of sound to display data, monitor systems, and provide enhanced user interfaces for computers and virtual reality systems. It is unique in its singular focus on auditory displays and the array of perception, technology, and application areas that this encompasses, which include for example data sonification, auditory wayfinding, auditory graphs, speech interfaces, virtual environments, and associated perceptual, cognitive, technical, and technological research and development. Many of the interdisciplinary research and development efforts are of direct relevance to persons with perceptual disabilities, especially visual impairments; for example, developing wayfinding systems for the blind requires research into effective distance cues and object identifiers used in auditory displays. Research into the efficacy of auditory graphs may be used to help visually impaired students and scientists participate more fully in science. Even household devices can have more effective auditory displays that provide richer information than the basic ""beeps"" they presently tend to generate. A common approach in this field is universal design, wherein a display strategy is developed once, to be used by all kinds of users, including those with and without specific access issues. This year's conference theme is Sound in Learning; more details about the conference are available online at http://icad.org/icad2017/. The ICAD Think Tank is a doctoral consortium that promotes scholarship and networking among new researchers in this important emerging interdisciplinary area. It will help shape ongoing and future research projects that have clear and important implications for development of assistive technologies and universal access. The doctoral consortium will afford participants exposure to a larger community, allowing them to bond among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality and culture, scientific discipline, and institution, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field. This year, the organizers expect that up to 10 U.S.-based Think Tank Scholars will have their travel and attendance heavily subsidized. Additionally, up to 3 U.S.-based Think Tank Scholars local to the central Pennsylvania area will have their attendance at ICAD 2017 (but not travel and accommodation) subsidized, for a total of 13 Student Scholars. Some NSF funds will also be used to support travel by research faculty panelists (both U.S. and foreign-based), since they provide great value to the US students, but NSF funds will not be used to support travel and participation of non-U.S. students. The organizers will be proactive in promoting diversity among the attendees. Stage in their academic program, research topic, gender and disability status are examples of dimensions on which participant diversity will be pursued; geographic and institutional diversity will also be strongly considered.<br/><br/>The ICAD Think Tank, a full-day event which will take place on June 19 immediately preceding the conference, is open to graduate students at all stages of their educational program, including both Masters and PhD students. Exceptional undergraduates who have demonstrated interest in pursuing this field in their graduate careers may also be considered. The Think Tank will bring together students from diverse backgrounds (e.g., engineering, computing, music, and psychology), so that they can experience the broad spectrum of approaches to auditory displays, assistive technologies and universal design. The Think Tank will develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, by providing participants with a friendly and open, yet rigorous, scientific forum in which to present their research ideas, to listen to ongoing work from peer students, and to receive constructive feedback from a panel of distinguished experts. Panel feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The Think Tank will also offer invited speakers and discussion groups (e.g., to provide students with relevant information about important issues for doctoral candidates, whether they are considering academic or industrial career paths). Each student participant will furthermore present his/her work in a special poster session during the conference proper. And the Think Tank Chair will provide a summary/review/debrief at the conference banquet that includes an overview of the event's success and in which all Think Tank participants (students and panelists) are introduced to the community.","12/21/2016","12/21/2016","1720407","Mark","Ballora","meb26@psu.edu","12/21/2016","Principal Investigator","Pennsylvania State Univ University Park","UNIVERSITY PARK","168027000","8148651372","110 Technology Center Building","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The number of computers in these clouds is rapidly increasing, surpassing hundreds of thousands today. Making large and parallel computing facilities generically available is desirable both from the business as well as the scientific perspective. Specifically, researchers today do not need to own an expensive supercomputer for studying complex systems, since they can tap into the cloud for hours, weeks or months at a time, well below the cost that they would need to pay to maintain a much smaller facility. This research will provide new tractable mathematical techniques for the analysis and efficient control of these large-scale systems.<br/><br/>The complexity of many of the systems used today for the distributed processing of large computing jobs makes it difficult to understand the impact of server information on designing scheduling protocols. The research done through this award will start by analyzing a mathematically tractable model for a network of servers where jobs are, upon arrival, split into a number of pieces, which are then assigned/queued at randomly chosen servers. The main characteristic of the model is that all pieces of a job must receive service in a synchronized fashion. This model, combined with a second model where jobs wait for the required number of servers to become available, will provide a benchmark for designing as well as quantifying the gains of practical scheduling policies. By noting that the two models constitute the extreme cases of having no server information versus having full, centralized information, this work will essentially provide a price for this knowledge, which will play an important role in designing future cloud systems.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1723812","Mariana","Olvera-Cravioto","molvera@berkeley.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","006Y","OE Operations Engineering","072E","NETWORKS & QUEUING SYSTEMS","073E","OPTIMIZATION & DECISION MAKING","077E","SIMULATION MODELS","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The researcher proposes that rather than focusing on whether LD students can or cannot develop conceptual understanding of fractions, research should attempt to uncover the understanding LD students have and examine how growth of conceptual knowledge occurs in these students. This approach suggests a reconceptualization of research and instructional practice in mathematics that focus on the conceptual knowledge students with LD can in fact develop.<br/><br/>Through a series of teaching experiments that involve cycles of theorizing, design, implementation, and refinement, the project develops instructional trajectories for LD students in the area of fractions. The research question addressed are: What initial and developing key developmental understandings of fractions do students with learning disabilities evidence through employed strategies, language, and representations? How do students with learning disabilities progress in developing and solidifying conceptual understandings of fractions through their mathematical activity? And, to what extent does an intervention reflective of a research based instructional trajectory facilitate strategic development and increased fraction conceptual knowledge in students with learning disabilities?<br/><br/>The main outcomes of the project include (a) a research-based instructional trajectory for students with LD specific to conceptual understandings of fractions as numeric quantities, (b) a set of 90 fraction tasks to be used for instruction and/or formative assessment in fraction concepts, (c) scoring/coding frameworks and checklists for use with key tasks as formative assessments, (d) decision-making frameworks, task sequencing guides, and suggestions to aid teachers in designing individualized, student-centered instruction, all available via the Internet. Most important, the project has the potential to offer a transformative approach to mathematics instruction for students with LD, bringing together expertise on learning disabilities and mathematics education to address a area in which there is very little research. <br/><br/>The PI will incorporate finding from the study into methods courses for both mathematics education and special education students. She will also develop a graduate course entitled Diagnosis and Remediation.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1708327","Jessica","Hunt","jhunt5@ncsu.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Schmid","Plasma technology plays a critical role in manufacturing of electronic devices, such as flat panel displays, computer chips, and solar panels. Industry plasmas currently used for manufacturing suffer from multiple limitations, including low plasma density (which slows processing), poor uniformity over large areas, contamination of plasma and the resulting materials, and inefficient energy use. This award supports fundamental research on high-density plasma using a unique magnetically enhanced inductive plasma source. New knowledge obtained from the research will lead to novel plasma sources that enable efficient manufacturing of electronic devices and various thin-film products, significantly reducing the costs of consumer electronics, promoting the adoption of clean energy, and reducing the negative impact of manufacturing on the environment. This project will strengthen university-industry collaboration and economic competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry. It will also contribute to workforce development by training students and attracting local tribal students to science and engineering. <br/><br/>Industry plasmas are created by strong electromagnetic fields. The efficiency of plasma processing is mainly determined by plasma density, plasma temperature, and energy distribution of electrons and ions. Conventional low-density plasmas are excited by unconfined electromagnetic fields that allow energetic electrons to escape easily from the plasma region, while high-density plasmas can be created by confined electromagnetic fields that retain energetic electrons within the plasma region to greatly extend their lifetime. The confined electric and magnetic fields act simultaneously and have interaction effects on the plasma. Little is known about the properties of high-density plasma created by confined electromagnetic fields and the effects of the primary induction parameters (excitation frequency and magnetic field distribution) on plasma properties. To fill this knowledge gap, the research team will perform three tasks. First, establish a plasma simulation model using dedicated software COMSOL to describe fundamental plasma properties (including plasma density, plasma temperature, and energy distribution of electrons and ions). Second, use the established model to predict effects of excitation frequency and magnetic field distribution on plasma properties. Finally, verify some of the predicted results by experiments. For example, plasma density and electron energy distribution at a limited number of points of the plasma region will be measured using a Langmuir probe, and plasma density over the entire plasma region will be indirectly measured using an optical emission spectrometer.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1700785","Qi","Fan","qfan@egr.msu.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1468","Manufacturing Machines & Equip","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC","9146","MANUFACTURING BASE RESEARCH","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","MANU","MANUFACTURING","1468","MANUFACTURING & CONST MACH EQP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9150",NA,NA,NA,"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This process has been exploited in recent years for the synthesis of nanoscale ceramics. However, the amount and quality of the electrospun mats produced are still close to a laboratory-scale. The focus of this award is to advance ceramic nanofiber electrospinning to ensure high process yield, process and product repeatability and reproducibility, along with optimized quality control. The anticipated result is a commercially-viable, high-throughput, nanomanufacturing process that produces functional nano-ceramics in large volumes and at a low cost. Processing of advanced photocatalysts for solar energy conversion to hydrogen fuel through water splitting is one of the targeted applications for the electrospun oxides addressed by this award. There are multiple anticipated benefits to the US economy and the welfare of the society, in terms of material availability and it's use in harvesting energy from the sun. This multidisciplinary project brings together expertise in materials manufacturing, nanomaterials synthesis, electrochemistry, mechanical engineering, and computational modeling. This award will add to the skilled workforce that will guide the growth of new industries for nanomaterials manufacturing based on ceramic electrospinning, thus creating more jobs. <br/><br/>This award addresses fundamental issues related to the mechanism of formation of large-scale 3D mats, comprised of self-supported, high surface area, ceramic oxide nanostructures. It spans several disciplines, and it is the joint effort between four collaborators with complementary expertise in nanofibrous materials processing, structural and mechanical property characterization and modeling, and photocatalytic property assessment. The structural features of the as-spun and calcined nanofibrous mats will be modeled to enable the fine-tuning of their processing conditions and to optimize the final design of the high-throughput process. The measurement of the mechanical properties of the electrospun mats will determine how they will perform as photocatalytic blankets. Assessment of the photoelectrochemical properties of the mats will guide their tailored synthesis. The methods and techniques employed in this work are expected to revolutionize industrial processes for the nanomanufacturing of self-supported / non-dispersed ceramic nanofibrous mats for energy-related applications.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Engineering Directorate and the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1724342","Pelagia","Gouma","pelagia.gouma@uta.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Arlington","Arlington","760190145","8172722105","1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT","United States","Texas","TX","1674","NANOSCALE: INTRDISCPL RESRCH T","081E","NANO SCALE ASSEMBLY","084E","NANOMANUFACTURING","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1774",NA,NA,NA,"CERAMICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kuech","Thermoelectric materials are materials which can be used to convert thermal energy directly to electricity. The performance of a thermoelectric material is measured by the ""figure of merit"", termed ZT. There has been much research into increasing thermoelectric materials, figure of merit, however, progress in this area has been slow and most of the researched thermoelectric materials up to now are suffering from either high fabrication cost, usage of rare earth or toxic elements, or poor mechanical properties. Organic thermoelectric materials (OTEs) have recently attracted attention for low temperature applications (< 300K), especially cooling purposes, as they are flexible, low-cost and abundant, and low-cost fabrication methods for synthesizing them exist. However, the ZT of the state-of-the-art OTEs is significantly lower than the ZT of their inorganic counterparts. In fact, there are only few candidates for low temperature thermoelectric devices even among inorganic materials. In the case of inorganic thermoelectric materials, the limiting factor in improving ZT is the electron mobility. This work will allow for the fabrication of high-ZT thermoelectric materials by addressing the challenges in mobility enhancement. This will be done by combining the two classes of materials (organic and inorganic), using a fabrication scheme in which high-mobility inorganic nanowires are embedded inside organic compounds. The researchers are a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise and with common interest in the thermoelectric field. Graduate and Undergraduate Students involved in this project therefore will benefit largely from the multidisciplinary nature of the work.<br/><br/>This work is applying new doping schemes (3D modulation-doping and field-effect doping) to hybrid organic-inorganic materials and to simulate, design, fabricate and characterize a new class of low temperature thermoelectric nanocomposites. The two-phase material uses the organic phase (e.g. conjugated-polymer or organic molecules) as a source of electrons and the inorganic semiconducting phase (e.g. Si nanowires) as the electron transport channel with high mobility. The key is to use the modulation-doping scheme to favor carrier transfer from the source of carriers (e.g. conjugated-polymer) to the high mobility inorganic semiconducting phase (inorganic nanowires) and optimize the carrier concentration to design a high Z hybrid thermoelectric material. A large class of semiconducting nanostructures (e.g. Si, CdTe, Bi, and PbTe nanowires and holely structures) combined with conjugated polymers (e.g., chemically-modified PEDOT and low bandgap polymers) and organic molecules (specifically charged chemical species attached to molecules such as CF3- substituted styrene molecules) will be simulated, synthesized and optimized to identify new hybrid materials with a potentially high ZT.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1723353","Mona","Zebarjadi","mz6g@virginia.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Virginia Main Campus","CHARLOTTESVILLE","229044195","4349244270","P.O.

Traditional thermoelectric materials can be used for these applications; however, their use is limited due to their relatively low thermal conductivities and low melting temperatures. The proposed research project centers on a new thermal-to-electrical energy harvesting/conversion method comprised of a capillary-sized heat pipe filled with magnetic fluid that operates via temperature difference. When the magnetic fluid inside the oscillating heat pipe (OHP) is exposed to a solenoid, an electrical alternating-current is generated. The high thermal conductivity and temperature stability of OHPs will allow for their utilization in conditions and applications where traditional thermoelectric materials are not viable. This new waste-heat recovery process will provide a new method for energy recovery and thermal management in a wide range of energy efficient applications.<br/><br/>The project's research objective is to better understand ""thermofluidic induction"" a unique thermo-kinetic-electromagnetic energy conversion process inherent to temperature-driven flow of magnetic nanofluid near a solenoid which can result in heat transfer enhancement and electrical power generation. Well-designed experiments on various OHP platforms will be conducted to determine the influence of the design and operating parameters on the performance of these OHPs in terms of heat flux and electrical power generation. Various nanofluids will be synthesized and then characterized using a wide range of techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in order to determine their physical and thermal characteristics before and after OHP-operation. The effects of thermal fatigue and nanoparticle settling will be studied. A transparent OHP will also be constructed to better understand the extent to which the nanofluid and OHP operating parameters affect energy harvesting, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Thermo-kinetic-electromagnetic modeling will be accomplished by utilizing and modifying available multiphysics software on select OHP models. The research objectives are to determine: (1) the extent to which the magnetic field and heat transfer are coupled in thermally-driven, pulsating capillary flow of ferro-nanofluid near a solenoid, (2) how to effectively transfer heat and/or generate a magnetic field in an oscillating heat pipe by varying specific design parameters, (3) the extent to which thermally-driven, pulsating capillary flows of ferro-nanofluids can: (i) enhance heat transfer and/or (ii) affect nanoparticle suspendability (agglomeration) and particle size/distribution (i.e. thermal fatigue of nanofluids) and finally (4) a novel, multiphysics analytical/numerical model that aids in predicting heat transfer and electrical power generation inherent to thermofluidic induction.","12/22/2016","12/22/2016","1720370","Keisha","Walters","Keisha.walters@ou.edu","12/22/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Oklahoma Norman Campus","NORMAN","730199705","4053254757","201 Stephenson Parkway","United States","Oklahoma","OK","1406","THERMAL TRANSPORT PROCESSES","064E","Convection heat and mass transfer","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The behavior and failure mechanisms in RC joints have been extensively studied in the past and are well understood under simple (planar) loading conditions. Current practice tells us to increase the joint dimensions or the amount of reinforcing steel to enhance the capacity of the joints and prevent premature failure. However, this approach is definitely not sustainable. Additionally, as observed in recent earthquakes, this practice does not always prevent catastrophic failures in the joint region, leading to the conclusion that the behavior of joints under complex (multi-axial) loading conditions is still not well understood.<br/><br/>In this project, high-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) will be selectively used at the beam-column joints to improve the structural performance of buildings while keeping the additional costs at a minimum. Using experimental and computational methods, a comparative damage evaluation and life-cycle cost assessment of building with RC and HPFRC joints will be conducted. Analysis of joints is a difficult task because of the complex load transfer and the behavior of materials under multi-axial loading. Therefore, two multi-axial (6 degree-of-freedom) loading units will be used to impose realistic loading and boundary conditions on the joints, and a digital-image correlation system for non-contact deformation measurements (DIC) will be used to obtain full-field 3-D strain maps to study critical deformation states that lead to the initiation of damage as well as its progression until complete failure. These research activities are anticipated to yield critical new knowledge and understanding of the behavior of RC and R-HPFRC joints, and reliable computational tools to study the RC/reinforced-HPFRC material and joint behavior.<br/><br/>Broader Significance and Importance<br/><br/>The proposed novel approach is expected to transform the design and construction of RC beam-column joints over the long-term. A direct benefit of this project to society is the improvement in public safety in response to earthquakes. An additional benefit is increased sustainability in the form of reduced direct and indirect economic losses and environmental impacts. The achievements in this project will be a large step in reaching the ultimate goal of resilient and sustainable civil infrastructures. The proposed joint concept also has broad applicability in other types of concrete construction, including offshore and nuclear structures. The data collected from these novel testing and measurement approaches will serve as benchmarks for the development of new theories for numerical modeling and engineering simulations, which could not be considered previously because of the lack of supporting experimental data.<br/><br/>Broadening Participation Activities<br/><br/>The University of Houston (UH) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The UH student body of nearly 40,000 students is one of the most diverse in the United States. Educational modules will be developed and introduced in three courses to influence the education of more than 100 students per year. Because of the inherent campus diversity, these educational initiatives will naturally reach a diverse audience. Graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited from underrepresented groups. In collaboration with a local high school with more than 90% underrepresented students, a field trip will be organized every year for 25 students to visit the UH campus and participate in hands-on training. In addition, one high school teacher will be recruited every summer to gain exposure to research activities and help develop a course module for high school physics courses.

Glinert","This is funding to provide financial support for approximately 20 graduate students (all from U. S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2017 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2017), to be held March 13-16 in Limassol, Cypress, about 10 of them as participants in a special Student Consortium (workshop), and the rest as presenters in the main conference and/or as attendees at the conference for general training purposes. Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces. Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place. Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc. IUI 2017 will be the 22nd conference in the series; more information about the conference is available online at http://iui.acm.org/2017. This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons. It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement. The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants. The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference. The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community. Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate. To further assure diversity, no more than two students will be accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The IUI 2017 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events. The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 13 in parallel with the conference workshops and the day before the start of the technical program. Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers. A group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.","12/23/2016","12/23/2016","1719307","Wai-Tat","Fu","wfu@illinois.edu","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Greenspan","Software is a critical element in a wide range of real-world applications. Attacks against computer software can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. In fact, many new software security vulnerabilities are discovered on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vital to identify and resolve those security issues as early as possible. This research aims to investigate a scientific foundation and a novel methodology for automated detection, prevention, and resolution of prior-known software security vulnerabilities in software systems. The results will help to detect and prevent prior-known security vulnerabilities from recurring in other software systems.<br/><br/>In this research, the key philosophy is that the software systems having the same/similar software security vulnerabilities share the protocols, algorithms, procedures, libraries, frameworks, modules, or source code with the same flaws, and they suffer the same/similar exploitation mechanisms. Based on that, empirical studies are conducted to investigate the nature and the characteristics of recurring software vulnerabilities in different software systems, and to validate that hypothesis. Based on the knowledge gained from the studies, new vulnerability models, representations, and similarity measurements are developed to capture recurring software security vulnerabilities, and the corresponding vulnerable code and exploitation mechanisms. Novel algorithms and techniques are designed to (semi-)automatically build graph-based vulnerability models from vulnerability reports and from vulnerable code and patches, aiming to construct a database of prior-known vulnerabilities. A new methodology is developed to help to identify the prior-known vulnerabilities in other systems and to suggest the resolution. Specifically, the automated methods and advances include 1) an algorithm to compare and match against vulnerability models in the database, 2) a technique to map software concepts between security reports and from a report to the corresponding source code fragments, modules, or components; 3) an algorithm to determine the modules and source file locations in the new system that correspond to the vulnerable modules and locations in a system with a prior-known vulnerability; and 4) a technique to suggest the patch to the new system from the prior fixes. In brief, the results of this research help to resolve early software security vulnerabilities. They will lead to more reliable software because the process of detecting and patching for recurring security vulnerabilities will be more efficient and effective.","12/23/2016","12/23/2016","1723198","Tien","Nguyen","tien@iastate.edu","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Dallas","Richardson","750803021","9728832313","800 W.

Nontechnical:<br/>Millions of people suffer from major chronic diseases such as cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, and infectious disease. To improve survival rates of patients and give the right treatment at the right time, early diagnosis of these diseases is required. The most common way to diagnose these diseases is to use a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule in a solution through the use of an antibody. The current gold standard biochemical test for detecting these biomarkers is called an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such tests have significant limitations with respect to the required sample volume, total testing time, expensive fluorescence detection and an inability to test for many biomarkers simultaneously. A simpler and more cost effective approach is still needed to achieve a more efficient biochemical testing platform. In this research project, we will demonstrate a novel optical cavity biosensor, a sensor that detects the concentration of biomarkers with simple two partially reflecting mirror structure, integrated with a simple microfluidic device. This integrated device enables automated, low-cost, and highly sensitive sensing which is required for various molecular diagnostic fields. Such rapid, simple and cost effective label-free biosensors have the potential to transform the field of early disease screening and to make significant impact on various clinical and healthcare applications. In addition, a new bio-sample handling technique will be implemented to make overall testing procedures simple.<br/>The education and outreach activity of this project is well-aligned with the research approach and outcomes. By educating undergraduate and graduate students through summer research experiences, new courses, and seminars, we will be able to deliver the state-of-art techniques related with micro/nanotechnologies. More specifically, by adapting the use of microfluidic system and optic sensors into new courses, we will enhance hands-on learning of microfabrication and semiconductor/microfluidic processes. For K-12 students, we will use this advanced biosensing tool for STEM education. Real demonstration of this work will be broadened through the development and distribution of educational activities on the optical physics and micro-flow phenomena. <br/><br/>3b. Technical:<br/>A standard ELISA process includes a laborious and time-consuming sample preparation and labeling processes that involve complicated multi-step chemical reactions, expensive fluorescence and laser equipment to detect a labeled molecule. A simpler and cost effective approach is still needed to achieve a more efficient immunoassay platform. By developing optical cavity biosensor arrays, we will achieve the ultimate goal in biosensors which is a combination of label-free, low cost, high sensitivity, and high selectivity. In addition, adapting a differential detection method with multiple diode systems enables a multiplexing immunoassay, enhances the sensor`s sensitivity and increases the linear dynamic range. By integrating the optical cavity sensor with the self-contained microfluidic platform, we will design SMDx (self-contained multiplexable label-free diagnostics) to achieve a label-free, multiplexable microfluidic molecular diagnostic system. In this platform, various bioassay protocols can be implemented using pumpless technology. Furthermore, the SMDx platform can be readily extended to a portable system by incorporating a modular biosensing system for reliable medical diagnostics.<br/><br/>This project has multiple aims:<br/> (1) Develop an affordable point-of-care biosensor using optical cavity structure enabling multiplexing bioassay with high sensitivity.<br/>(2) Understand sensitivity enhancement by increasing the responsivity of the transducer through the differential detection method. <br/>(3) Demonstrate a seamless microfluidic device containing passive flow control with channel surface properties and wicking force.<br/>(4) Implement a self-contained multiplex label-free diagnostics (SMDx) platform for cardiac panel screenings.","12/23/2016","12/23/2016","1707049","Seunghyun","Kim","seunghyun_kim@baylor.edu","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","Baylor University","Waco","767987360","2547103817","One Bear Place #97360","United States","Texas","TX","7564","COMMS, CIRCUITS & SENS SYS","104E","MEMS/NEMS","090E","Chem/Bio and Physical Diagnostics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

High temperature can disrupt the endosymbioses between dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.) and reef-building corals (i.e. coral bleaching), thereby risking the global loss of a critical marine ecosystem. The physiological, ecological and evolutionary responses of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses to environmental stress brought on by global climate change are complex. The spread of certain types of symbiotic algae may increase the thermal stress tolerance among corals and help them persist in warmer oceans, but perhaps not without trade-offs to the health of the coral. The dinoflagellate tentatively named Symbiodinium trenchi has become increasingly more common in numerous corals throughout the Caribbean, but is often at low-abundance relative to other symbionts. While S. trenchi can increase in abundance during and after warming, it is often displaced by other symbionts following a return to normal conditions. Genetic evidence indicates that S. trenchi recently invaded and/or expanded in the Caribbean and has developed associations with many corals that seem to be poorly optimized, or mal-adapted, relative to the symbioses it maintains with corals in the Indo-Pacific.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the symbiosis ecology and physiology of S. trenchi in corals from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Bleaching experiments will examine the effects of increased temperature on transfer of carbon from the algae to the host coral (via stable isotopic tagging), as well as photosynthesis and growth among colonies harboring S. trenchi compared to colonies harboring other Symbiodinium spp. The potential for symbiont community shifts as well as altered long-term colony growth based on bleaching severity and recovery time will be investigated. A reciprocal transplant study will examine the competitive interaction and stability of symbionts among Pacific corals. These studies will test if the continued spread of S. trenchi will affect coral growth in the Caribbean and whether it might behave similarly in the Indo-Pacific if environmental conditions worsen. The results from this project have the potential to supply transformative information regarding how (or if) a widely distributed symbiotic algal species may influence the resilience of reef-building corals and their potential to survive projected increases in ocean warming due to climate change.<br/><br/>In addition to training one postdoctoral scholar and several graduate students, this project will enhance scientific discovery and participation of underrepresented groups via several outreach efforts with the Palau National Aquarium, Palau International Coral Reef Center, and local schools. Educational units in marine symbioses and science will be developed with several local high school teachers and students, and unique research opportunities will be provided to students at the Palau Community College. Likewise, a new educational display addressing how global climate may impact coral reefs, and describing the current research to better understand the physiology of coral-algal symbioses, will be developed and presented at the University of Delaware open house ""Coast Day."" The display will be donated subsequently to the Palau Aquarium for future use.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.","12/23/2016","12/23/2016","1719675","Dustin","Kemp","dwk@uab.edu","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Alabama at Birmingham","Birmingham","352940001","2059345266","AB 1170","United States","Alabama","AL","7657","Integrative Ecologi Physiology","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gilchrist","Life on Earth includes both very simple and rather complex organisms. The central question motivating this research is how do simple organisms evolve into complex organisms? The origin of organisms composed of more than one cell (i.e., multicellular organisms) was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems, such as plants and animals, to evolve. However, understanding how and why this kind of complexity has increased in some lineages remains a major challenge for evolutionary biology. The challenges posed by the evolution of multicellularity, for example, in the evolution of mechanisms for sharing labor and cooperating among the cells within an organism, underlie many medical conditions and are foundational in understanding genotype to phenotype relationships. The goal of this project is to experimentally evolve multicellularity under controlled conditions and study the pathways involved. This project will also develop novel curriculum materials for teaching high school students about cellular differentiation and the challenges of multicellularity. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to experimentally evolve multicellularity in the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. C. reinhardtii is an established model system with a well-developed set of genetic tools. Its relatives among the volvocine algae range from species having single cells to those having tens of thousands of cells of different cell types. Generation of a novel origin of multicellularity in the lab will enable direct comparison of multicellular descendants to their unicellular ancestors. Twelve replicate populations will be evolved in the presence of a filter-feeding predator, conditions known to favor multicellularity. Genetic changes that occur over the course of these experiments will be tracked to reveal the genetic basis of multicellularity and the evolutionary processes giving rise to those changes. Experimental data will be compared with the evolutionary and genetic routes by which multicellularity evolved in the volvocine algae. Finally, the role of environmentally induced developmental changes in the evolution of multicellularity will be evaluated.","12/23/2016","01/04/2017","1723293","Matthew","Herron","xprinceps@gmail.com","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS","1355","EGC EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9150",NA,NA,NA,"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specific objectives include characterizing grades 3-5 teachers' responsive decision making in the domain of rational numbers, investigating how professional development can support the development of this form of teaching expertise, and exploring the relationship between degree of teachers' responsive decision making and student learning. Theoretical and practical contributions of this project address the discrepancy in the field's capacity to produce research-based knowledge about children's thinking versus provide resources to take up and effectively use this knowledge. The primary organization is The University of Texas at Austin, and major partner organizations include the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, SRI International, and Teachers Development Group.<br/><br/>In this professional development design study, researchers engage approximately 100 teachers in up to three years of professional development designed to empower teachers to make instructional decisions guided by a research-based framework of children's thinking about rational numbers, with an emphasis on children's informal ideas of partitioning quantities and their understanding of the fundamental properties of operations and equality. Data sources include direct observation of workshops and teachers' classrooms as well as teachers' performance and reflection on a variety of assessments. On the basis of what is learned from these multiple data sources across 3 cohorts of teachers, researchers will iteratively build and refine a model of responsive decision making and identify critical features of the development of this expertise. Further, using approximately half the sample, researchers collect student data to test the conjecture that responsive decision making is related to increased opportunities for students to learn.<br/><br/>The findings, assessments, and professional development generated by this project will help the field respond to the critical challenge of how to support teachers to take up and effectively use knowledge of children's mathematical thinking in instruction. Anticipated intellectual products include a model of teachers' responsive decision making in the domain of rational numbers, identification of landmarks and obstacles in teachers' development of responsive decision making, and knowledge about the relationship between teachers' expertise in responsive decision making and student learning. Anticipated professional development products include a web-based tool to support teachers' self-guided collaborative inquiry and a well-specified, scalable professional development course for teachers with an immediate outlet for dissemination through the ongoing work of Teachers Development Group.","12/23/2016","12/23/2016","1712560","Susan","Empson","empsons@missouri.edu","12/23/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Missouri-Columbia","COLUMBIA","652110001","5738827560","115 Business Loop 70 W","United States","Missouri","MO","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12","9177","ELEMENTARY/SECONDARY EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In many Alaskan rural communities, whose primary population is Alaska Native people, the elderly are still relied upon for their deep knowledge and understanding of the natural environment, heritage languages, and cultural practices which are important not only for economic survival but social cohesion and community wellbeing. However, change is deeply affecting Alaska Native communities and Alaska Native people are forced to adapt to the new environmental, economic and social realities that affect their worlds. This research project will explore how Alaska Native elderly are adapting to rapid economic, environmental, and social change by exploring Alaska Native elderly and their own understanding and definition of what successful aging means to them. <br/><br/>The current research project will establish a better understanding of successful aging from the perspectives of Alaska Native elderly in Northwest Alaska. Being the Principal Investigators second research project on this topic, this project has the potential to inform future studies of indigenous successful aging, studies that allow the elderly themselves to subjectively define for themselves what it means to age well. In the spirit of community-based participatory research, several communities in Northwest Alaska reached out to the principal investigator, Dr. Jordan P. Lewis (Aleut, Native Village of Naknek), to request that similar research be conducted in their region. They did so after learning of his ""Successful Aging Study,"" which was carried out in Bristol Bay Alaska from 2011-2014 and brought awareness of the value of positive, or generative, focused research with the elderly, highlighting their lessons and knowledge for healthy aging. <br/><br/>This research study will consist of 60 qualitative in-depth interviews with Alaska Native elderly to establish an indigenous understanding of what successful aging means for Alaska Natives in Northwest Alaska and what is required to age in place. Interviews will be conducted with Alaska Native elderly and their family members in their own homes in five participating communities, as well as those who have relocated to the Quyanna Care facility in Nome, Alaska. Through these interviews the research team will to explore the concept of successful aging and hope to gain a sense of Alaska Native beliefs about aging, what is required to age in place? and how relocation to facilities for the elderly impacts views of successful aging? In the spirit of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), participants will be engaged through the entire research process, from conception to data analysis. Meetings will be held in participating communities to review the findings and receive feedback; this will ensure the findings reflect the unique perspectives of the Elders, families, communities, and region. These findings will also be compared with the previous study on successful aging conducted in Bristol Bay to compare and contrast experiences of aging in these two rural regions of Alaska. This study will also explore what is required to age in place to reduce or eliminate the need for the elderly to relocate - taking with them the language, culture, and history of the community. Previous research by the PI has shown that enabling older Alaskan Native people to remain in their homes and communities contributes to the health and wellbeing of the communities. The research will shed additional light on what it means to age well in rural Alaska and determine what role their community plays in how Alaska Native people subjectively define their aging process. <br/><br/>The significance of this proposed research advances discovery through the establishment of a locally and culturally informed, Alaska Native, understanding of successful aging that builds on the PI's previous projects. In addition to contributing to the academic literature on successful aging, it promotes teaching and learning from the Elders on healthy aging in rural Alaska. It also educates researchers on the importance of CBPR and allowing the elderly to subjectively define their aging process, as well as engaging the local community throughout the entire research process, which promotes the coproduction of knowledge and bi-directional learning. This research project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups (Alaska Natives) and puts them on equal footing with the scientists in interpreting results and in presenting the results. This research also has the potential to contribute to the disciplines of anthropology, gerontology, community psychology, sociology, and others by paving the way for future researchers interested in indigenous aging. <br/><br/>The research findings can influence health and social policy in Alaska and how healthcare and long-term support services are delivered to older residents in rural communities. The results of this research will be published and be disseminated for other researchers, gerontologists, anthropologists, and students to use with the permission of the tribal governing authorities, the Alaska Native participants and their communities. This study will also highlight that aging does not have to equal poor health and immobility; aging well should be a right that can be attained by everyone. This research has the potential to inform health professionals, policy advocates, local and state officials about the factors that determine whether or not rural Alaska communities are able to meet the needs of their elderly and enable them to live their remaining years as they may wish.","12/27/2016","12/27/2016","1719404","Jordan","Lewis","jplewis@alaska.edu","12/27/2016","Principal Investigator","University of Alaska Anchorage Campus","ANCHORAGE","995084614","9077861065","3211 PROVIDENCE DRIVE","United States","Alaska","AK","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kimbrel","Statistical models provide a powerful means of quantifying uncertainty, modeling prior beliefs, and describing complex dependencies in data. The process of using a model to answer specific questions, such as inferring the state of several random variables given evidence observed about others, is called probabilistic inference. Probabilistic graphical models, a type of statistical model, are often used in diverse applications such as medical diagnosis, understanding protein and gene regulatory networks, computer vision, and language understanding. On account of the central role played by probabilistic graphical models in a wide range of automated reasoning applications, designing efficient algorithms for probabilistic inference is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and machine learning.<br/><br/>Probabilistic inference in many of these applications corresponds to a complex combinatorial optimization problem that at first glance appears to be extremely difficult to solve. However, practitioners have made significant strides in designing heuristic algorithms to perform real-world inference accurately and efficiently. This project focuses on bridging the gap between theory and practice for probabilistic inference problems in large-scale machine learning systems. The PIs will identify structural properties and methods of analysis that differentiate real-world instances from worst-case instances used to show NP-hardness, and will design efficient algorithms with provable guarantees that would apply to most real-world instances. The project will also study why heuristics like linear programming and other convex relaxations are so successful on real-world instances. The efficient algorithms for probabilistic inference developed as part of this project have the potential to be transformative in machine learning, statistics, and more applied areas like computer vision, social networks and computational biology. To help disseminate the research and foster new collaborations, a series of workshops will be organized bringing together the theoretical computer science and machine learning communities. Additionally, undergraduate curricula will be developed that use machine learning to introduce students to concepts in theoretical computer science.","12/28/2016","12/28/2016","1723344","David","Sontag","das19@nyu.edu","12/28/2016","Principal Investigator","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Cambridge","021394301","6172531000","77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7239","Algorithms in the Field",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This conference will facilitate interactions between students and faculty with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest. Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 80 participants are expected, including students and both junior and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-PhD granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research. More information can be found at the conference webpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2017.html.<br/><br/>The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics, including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory, and cryptography. Our speakers are specialists in characteristics p techniques in commutative algebra and geometry, arithmetic geometry and number theory, numerical algebraic geometry, combinatorial commutative algebra, Lie Theory and Rees Algebras. This wide variety of interests among our speakers should bolster new algebraic interactions between all participants.","12/28/2016","12/28/2016","1700755","Louiza","Fouli","lfouli@nmsu.edu","12/28/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","University of New Mexico","Albuquerque","871310001","5052774186","1700 Lomas Blvd. NE, Suite 2200","United States","New Mexico","NM","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Janet","Vassilev","jvassil@math.unm.edu","12/28/2016","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"David","Jorgensen","djorgens@uta.edu","12/28/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","Lars","Christensen","Lars.W.Christensen@ttu.edu","12/28/2016","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Baheti","The goal of the proposed research is to develop the next generation of algorithms to achieve significant improvement in short-term wind forecasting. Our inability to accurately capture non-Gaussian uncertainty of wind in high dimensional spaces translates to low predictability; high risk and the need for expensive balancing power resources. It is thus a primary objective of the proposed research is to significantly improve wind forecasts upto 48 hours in advance, leading to enhanced dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment operations in the day-ahead electricity market.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will develop an integrated framework of randomized algorithms for scalable nonlinear uncertainty propagation. Algorithm output will be combined with measured on-site data in the sense of Bayesian fusion, leading to a hybrid forecasting structure. The main technical challenges are: (i) complex wind dynamics due to multiple temporal and spatial scales, turbulence and orographic effects; (ii) non-Gaussian wind uncertainty; (iii) need for scalable algorithms due to high dimensionality; and (iv) need for fusion of information arriving from multiple algorithms and heterogeneous measurement sources. The proposed framework will have the following key features to meet these challenges: (1) formulation of the wind state as a stochastic hybrid process, governed by multiple reduced order<br/>micro and mesoscale models; (2) a novel randomized particle uncertainty propagation approach based on the method of characteristics, Markov chain Monte-Carlo and the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion. Practical effectiveness of developed algorithms will be measured against data from two wind-farms: the Cohocton Wind Farm/NY and the Roscoe Wind Farm/TX.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed forecasting framework will lead to increased penetration of wind power by reducing the risks currently associated with it; and enable us to achieve our global targets of reducing dependence on fossil-fuel based electricity. The education plan includes training high school teachers in the multidisciplinary area of sustainable energy who will in turn reach thousands of students.","12/28/2016","12/28/2016","1700753","Mrinal","Kumar","kumar.672@osu.edu","12/28/2016","Principal Investigator","Ohio State University","Columbus","432101016","6146888735","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Ohio","OH","7607","ENERGY,POWER,ADAPTIVE SYS","092E","Control systems & applications","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","155E","Electric power networks",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elizabethkingia is a ubiquitous group of bacteria whose presence in soil and water ordinarily pose little risk to human health. However, the current outbreak includes 63 confirmed cases, and has been associated with 18 confirmed fatalities since November 2015. This opportunistic human pathogen is particularly alarming because it tends to exhibit a high degree of antibiotic resistance and mortality. Given the emergence of this pathogen and the ongoing outbreak, it is important to develop a better understanding of how to effectively control these bacteria in drinking water. <br/><br/>This RAPID research project will provide the first direct assessment of inactivation of waterborne Elizabethkingia bacteria using chlorination, chloramination, ozonation, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Specific objectives of the proposed work include the following. Characterize the disinfection response of: 1) planktonic cells, 2) attached cells, and 3) develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between disinfection efficacy and Elizabethkingia composition. Laboratory experiments will be used to establish concentration (or UV intensity) x time relationships (referred to as CT relationships). This disinfectant response data is currently unknown, and is urgently needed to develop effective disinfection strategies to curtail the current outbreak and avoid future public health disasters. Additionally, this project will probe the relationship between the bacteria's composition (nucleic and amino acids) and susceptibility to different modes of disinfection. The proposed research will substantially contribute to advancing broader societal outcomes including improved understanding of drinking water disinfection strategies to better protect human health, which has immediate implications for curtailing the ongoing outbreak caused by Elizabethkingia bacteria and for preventing future outbreaks. Findings from this project will also be integrated into course modules/discussions in the PIs regular teaching rotation, a summer experience for high school students, and at the Emerging Contaminants Short Course offered annually at Marquette University for academics and professionals.","12/28/2016","12/28/2016","1700604","Kyana","Young","kyana.young@marquette.edu","12/28/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","Marquette University","Milwaukee","532011881","4142887200","P.O.

The need for this conference lies in the unique opportunity to bring these investigators together in one room for the first time to exchange ideas and brainstorm new strategies for moving the field of molecular and cellular engineering, mechanobiology and biomechanics for therapeutic applications forward. The CMBE field is experiencing exponential growth. A new international journal of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering was launched in 2008. The first BMES-CMBE conference was launched in 2013. The meeting has been held annually since then. Building upon these successes, the 2017 Conference will bring together leaders in the field of biology, medicine, and engineering to address pressing topics in CMBE research and education.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to support travel awards for students, postdoc fellows, and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) for the 2017 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference. The purpose of this meeting is to foster interdisciplinary interaction and to capitalize on the rapidly expanding scientific developments in several cutting-edge fields: molecular engineering, genomic editing, molecular imaging and manipulation in live cells. The main outcome of the meeting will be new strategies for the integrated application of these different technologies toward immuno-engineering and stem cell engineering under the context of mechanical microenvironment for therapeutics. There are two specific aims of this meeting: (1) Delineate the current status of different fields of molecular engineering, genomic editing, molecular imaging and actuation, mechanobiology and biomechanics, and immune and stem cell engineering; (2) Foster the free exchange of information across regions around the Pacific Rim in order to jointly push forward the boundaries of engineering and science in CMBE by leveraging the strength from different regions. We believe that this conference is the first of its kind and will create a gateway for the next generation of bioengineers and will be a vehicle toward future development in the midst of an amazing convergence of multiple cutting-edge areas in engineering technology, physical and mechanical sciences, and biomedical applications.","12/29/2016","12/29/2016","1719298","Yingxiao","Wang","yiw015@eng.ucsd.edu","12/29/2016","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","5345","Engineering of Biomed Systems","004E","BIOMEDICAL ENG AND DIAGNOSTICS","017E","Cellular and Tissue Engineering","024E","MATERIALS DESIGN","027E","NANOMECHANICS","028E","BIOMECHANICS","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7479",NA,NA,NA,"Biomechanics & Mechanobiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The workshop will foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among researchers throughout the field of algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics that stands at the intersection of several fundamental areas of research. This workshop's invited speakers reflect the diversity of current work in the area and include researchers at a variety of career stages in order to best capture a cross-section of the field today. The workshop will help establish ties between the growing community of topologists in the south, including Kentucky, Georgia and at Vanderbilt, with the long-standing community of researchers in the Midwest. These types of research connections are the building blocks for progress in mathematical research. Participants with established or emerging research programs will have a forum to publicize their work and more junior participants will have the opportunity to integrate into the wider topology community. The schedule of the conference is designed with breaks to encourage collaborations and informal mathematical interactions among the participants. Such opportunities are especially important for mathematicians early in their career. Incorporating young mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups into the scientific discourse is key to building a truly representative community of mathematicians. <br/><br/>The conference speakers represent a range of research in the field, from computations via chromatic homotopy theory to foundational development to algebraic and topological K-theory. Bringing together mathematicians from these areas will facilitate collaborations between Midwestern and Southern algebraic topologists working across the spectrum of homotopy theory today. Additionally, the speakers' research includes several areas of homotopy theory that have fruitful connections to other areas of pure mathematics, such as geometric group theory and dynamics. This workshop will serve to publicize these connections to researchers in Tennessee and surrounding states, where there has historically been little homotopy theory. Thus, a conference at Vanderbilt showcasing the range of present homotopical research will allow the establishment of mathematical ties both within the discipline and to other fields.

The website of the conference: https://sites.google.com/a/usc.edu/cnsl2017/home will be continuously updated prior to the conference and will provide a repository for the lectures of the meeting to be made available generally. In today's digital world, huge amounts of data, i.e., big data, can be found in almost every aspect of scientific research and every walk of human activities. These data need to be managed effectively for reliable prediction, inference, and improved decision making. Statistical learning is an emergent scientific discipline wherein mathematical modeling, computational algorithms, and statistical analysis are jointly employed to address such a data management problem. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers at all levels from multiple disciplines, including computational and applied mathematics, optimization, statistics, and engineering to report on the state of the art of the conference subject and exchange ideas for its further development. Collaborations among the participants will be fostered with the goal of advancing the science of the field of statistical learning and promoting the interfaces of the involved disciplines. The format of the conference consists of roughly two dozen lectures given by expert researchers of the field. Break times in-between the lectures are scheduled to allow discussions among all participants who will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers in academia and industry, and faculty members in universities. This award provides support targeted for the travel expenses of junior participants. <br/><br/>Till now, convex optimization has been a principal venue for solving many problems in statistical learning. Yet there is increasing evidence supporting the use of nonconvex formulations to enhance the realism of the models and improve their generalizations. Superior results and new advances have occurred in areas such as computational statistics, compressed sensing, imaging science, machine learning, bio-informatics and portfolio selection in which nonconvex functionals are employed to express model loss, promote sparsity, and enhance robustness. This conference provides a forum for the participants to report on their research and exchange ideas pertaining to the use of nonconvex functionals in statistical learning. The topics are organized in four main streams: modeling, advances in computation, big-data statistical learning, and innovative applications. The lectures will cover both theory and algorithms as well as promising directions for further research.","12/30/2016","12/30/2016","1719635","Meisam","Razaviyayn","razaviya@usc.edu","12/30/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Southern California","Los Angeles","900890001","2137407762","University Park","United States","California","CA","006y","COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phebe","Vayanos","phebe.vayanos@usc.edu","12/30/2016","Co-Principal Investigator","1271","8069",NA,NA,"CDS&E-MSS",NA,"Jong-Shi","Pang","jongship@usc.edu","12/30/2016","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This archive is a unique collection of sediment cores that has enabled a wide range of research advancing our understanding of Antarctic region and the Earth system. Oregon State University (OSU), under a separate award from NSF, will provide ongoing curatorial services for this collection through the OSU Marine and Geology Repository. This project is a comprehensive transition plan to move the Antarctic core collection from Florida State University to OSU with logging and digital archiving tasks completed by May 1, 2018. <br/><br/>Technical<br/>The Antarctic and the Southern Ocean National Collection of Rock and Sediment Cores currently housed at Florida State University will be relocated to Oregon State University (OSU) and housed along with the OSU Marine and Geology Repository. Oregon State University investigators will co-manage the Antarctic core collection and the Marine and Geology Repository as a single modern repository and analytical facility. The combined collection will be housed a new 33,000 square foot building with refrigerated space that can hold both collections with approximately five decades of expansion space. The co-location and co-management of these two collections offers unique curatorial synergies, cost savings, and improved capabilities to support both the research and educational needs of a wider marine and Antarctic communities. The facility will house a 32-person seminar room, a large 1,044 square foot core lab that allows layout, inspection and examination of cores, and adjoining analytical laboratories that will provide quantitative analysis as well as experiential learning opportunities for students. This award fund the transition and physical movement of the collection from Florida State to Oregon State. The transition plan is split into three phases, starting in January 2017 with reconnaissance of the current Antarctic core collection in Florida, data entry in the current repository database (Phase 1), labeling of all cores before they are put in boxes (Phase 2) and carrying out the actual move (Phase 3) in the first nine months of the transition plan. The goal is to finish the entire transition and full digital curation of the collection by 1 May 2018. The transition plan was developed to incorporate the best curatorial practices and to facilitate a successful move and transition of the irreplaceable Antarctic core collection from Florida State University to Oregon State University.","01/03/2017","01/03/2017","1722657","Anthony","Koppers","akoppers@coas.oregonstate.edu","01/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Oregon State University","Corvallis","973318507","5417374933","OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY","United States","Oregon","OR","1647","ANTARCTIC INSTRUM & SUPPORT","1647","ANTARCTIC INSTRUM & SUPPORT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Joseph","Stoner","jstoner@coas.oregonstate.edu","01/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rockcliffe","With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Corey J. Wilson of Yale University to conduct a rigorous study of protein-mediated energy transduction reactions. The process of energy transduction in protein systems is may be initiated by absorption of a photon by an ""antenna"" molecule, that channels that light energy into the attainment of an excited electronic state. The fate of the excited electron depends on a number of factors and productive reactions typically result in electron transfer or energy transfer through the protein. These reactions are essential to life-processes such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Accordingly, the long-term goal of this project is to leverage rational protein design methods to understand the principles that govern energy transduction in natural systems, which will enable the development of novel bio-electronic devices (e.g., energy harvesting paints for commercial uses as next generation solar energy production). This pursuit will allow graduate and undergraduate students to acquire specialized training both in advanced computational modeling and experimental photochemical methods. A particular effort willl be made to recruit members of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM as part of the research team.<br/><br/>This study will be accomplished with the use computational modeling and complementary experimentation to draw distinctions between the role of the coupling matrix in electron transfer versus energy transfer and to leverage this knowledge to develop new scoring functions for second generation designs in future work. The working hypothesis is the rate of energy transduction through a protein can be controlled via the strategic redesign of the intervening medium and can be optimized for electron transfer (EleT) or energy transfer (EngT) reactions. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to develop and experimentally test computational design strategies that will enable us to control the rate of energy transduction via pathway redesign with distinction for EleT and EngT reactions. In principle, modification of the EleT electronic coupling matrix and EngT bridge can result in tuning of and control over the rate of energy transduction.","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1723613","Corey","Wilson","corey.wilson@chbe.gatech.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","6883","Chemistry of Life Processes","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Glinert","This is funding to support next year's CSCW doctoral research consortium (workshop) of approximately 15 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with 4-6 distinguished research faculty. The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, to be held in Portland, OR, on February 25-March 1, and which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The CSCW conferences are the premier venue for the presentation of research relating to the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities and networks (including collaborative systems and social computing). The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of recreational and social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations. Research published at CSCW is heavily refereed and widely cited; ranked as the second most impactful HCI conference by Google Scholar Metrics (after CHI), the 2016 event was attended by approximately 700 top researchers from academia and industry around the world. CSCW 2017 will be the 20th conference in the series; more information may be found online at http://cscw.acm.org/2017/index.php. The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2017 will be a 1.5-day event taking place on Saturday and Sunday, February 25-26. Goals of the doctoral colloquium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. The first day of the Colloquium will be an afternoon session to allow participants a chance to get to know one another with structured small-group activities, including modeling the tradition of practice talks and providing one another with feedback on their presentations. Students who were paired for pre-colloquium feedback will listen to one another's talks and provide feedback. Practice talks are a tradition in research labs with strong mentoring and training cultures; the Doctoral Colloquium will model this practice for students who may not be part of a large research lab. During the second day, each student will make a formal 10-minute presentation about his or her doctoral research, culminating in a 20-minute session of discussion and feedback (both from members of the faculty panel and other student participants) on the work. The feedback will be geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Additional feedback will be provided by faculty panel members in informal one-on-one discussions during meal times, break times, and throughout the remainder of the conference. An informal working lunch will include an ""interrogating research life"" panel, in which mentors will give short statements and students will be encouraged to ask questions about different aspects of research life, including research career paths, funding, work-life balance, etc. Follow-up activities (including poster sessions) will take place during the conference's main technical program. Doctoral colloquium papers will be published in the Extended Abstracts for the conference, which will be available to attendees and online; in this way, the students' work will be disseminated in a more enduring form. The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure diversity and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW; in particular, they will limit acceptances to a maximum of two students from the same institution.","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1722523","Andrea","Forte","aforte@drexel.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator","Drexel University","Philadelphia","191021119","2158955849","1505 Race St, 8th Floor","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Glinert","This is funding to support participation by students and faculty based in U.S. educational institutions in a Graduate Student Symposium (workshop) to be organized in conjunction with the 2017 ACM Creativity & Cognition (C&C) conference, which will take place June 27-30 in Singapore. Creativity is the cornerstone and the fundamental motive of both the aesthetic and engineering disciplines. It is a critical element of our economic and social prosperity, as a precursor to scientific discoveries and technological advances. Held every other year in an international location since 1993, C&C serves as a gathering place for the diverse communities of researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on creativity and cognition as well as technological innovation. C&C is the only ACM-sponsored conference in which human creativity is the central focus, and as such it provides pathways for substantially different kinds of work including user studies of creativity support tools and new sensor technologies for creative practice. It serves as a premier forum for presenting the world's best new research investigating computing's impact on and ability to promote creativity in all forms of human experience. The conference particularly values research that explores new, synergistic roles for computing and people in creative processes, or that addresses situations where computing, as contextualized in sociotechnical systems, may sometimes have an undesirable impact. More information about the 11th conference, the first to be held in Asia, may be found online at http://cc.acm.org/2017/. The GSS will bring together up to 12 promising doctoral students (not all of whom who be eligible for funding) and 4 distinguished researchers from academia and industry as mentors, in a day-long event that will be held on June 26, 2017, the day before the main C&C conference. The student submissions will appear in the C&C Proceedings, and they will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library. The students will also be invited to present their work at the main conference during the poster session, which will give their work wider visibility in the community while also affording an opportunity for them to talk one-on-one with peers and other senior researchers. To promote diversity, no more than two graduate students will be accepted from any one institution, and if there are two then at least one of them must be female. Thus, the symposium will guide early stage research and creative explorations to advance knowledge and practice in the field of creativity and cognition, and contribute to the professional development of a more knowledgeable, capable, and productive workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>The GSS will provide graduate students with a unique opportunity to present early stage research and receive feedback from mentors with different disciplinary backgrounds. They will gain experience and skills in communicating their own work and critiquing the work of peers. They will come away with new research insights and possible directions, with better understanding of prior work and of the field overall, and with new awareness of potentially useful methods that draw from different disciplines. And they will have the opportunity to build professional and social connections that transcend the event, and to gain awareness of potential career paths in both academia and industry. During the morning, each student will briefly present his or her work in a short formal talk. Mentors will lead a brief discussion of the work, including the research question, method of addressing the question, possible results and findings, significance of the work, and pointers to related work and research areas. The mentors will also offer a critique of each student's written and oral presentation. These discussions will continue through a working lunch. In the afternoon the mentors will lead a broad discussion that relates the presentations to one another and to the other work in the field. They will attempt to highlight common themes that emerged across the individual student works, and note differences and similarities in research methods both across individual research projects as well as across diverse intellectual threads within the creativity and cognition field as a whole. In the last portion of the day, the mentors will lead a discussion on pursuing a career in this interdisciplinary field and what the opportunities are from different disciplinary perspectives.","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1723306","Kurt","Luther","kluther@vt.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","BLACKSBURG","240610001","5402315281","Sponsored Programs 0170","United States","Virginia","VA","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Social vulnerability has been receiving increasing attention by disaster planners at local, state, and federal levels as they seek to reduce adverse impacts of natural hazards. Yet far too little is currently understood about the robustness of the leading vulnerability indicators, both in terms of the approaches used to build them and their ability to adequately represent real world conditions. There is a critical need for methodological advancements to improve the precision and accuracy of social vulnerability indicators. Without such advancements, the use of social vulnerability indicators in disaster mitigation, preparedness, and recovery could mislead decision-making. Based on a study area of the Southeast U.S., the project will develop novel regionalization routines and apply global sensitivity analysis and multiple regression to census data inputs and output vulnerability indicators. The research is expected to generate new understanding of the critical inputs and decision points in social vulnerability modeling, the level of agreement of resultant indicators with observed disaster outcomes, and the influence of uncertainty in social vulnerability modeling. By narrowing the existing gap between vulnerability models and real-world practice, improved social vulnerability indicators will allow for better disaster planning and interventions that account for the most vulnerable populations.<br/><br/>The project has great potential to transform dominant approaches for the measurement of social vulnerability to hazards. The finalized methodology will be made widely accessible to both researchers and the public through an internet-GIS application that generates user-customizable vulnerability indices. The improved vulnerability metrics will also be shared with state and federal disaster planners through existing relationships with the research team. The study contributes to training the next generation of hazards researchers through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in graduate research and education. The project findings will be integrated into the classroom through the development of learning modules for existing courses that explore urban geography and interactions between hazards and society.","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1707947","Christopher","Emrich","emrich@mailbox.sc.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Central Florida","ORLANDO","328168005","4078230387","4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD","United States","Florida","FL","1638","INFRAST MGMT & EXTREME EVENTS","041E","HAZARD AND DISASTER REDUCTION","042E","HAZARD AND DISASTER RESPONSE","1352","GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9196","NATURAL DISASTERS","9278","HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1352",NA,NA,NA,"GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1638","INFRAST MGMT & EXTREME EVENTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The conference has 30 confirmed speakers in very active and fundamental areas at the intersection of probability, analysis, and mathematical physics. The main aim in the rigorous study of complex disordered systems is to understand how random microscopic systems display predictable and statistically universal collective macroscopic behaviors. Many such systems evolve to stationary states, but do so in very long time scales (e.g., exponential in system size). Dynamics and aging in these complex systems seeks to understand how their complicated energy landscapes governs their pre-stationary behavior. There are many different approaches in this area that will be represented at the conference, including spin-glasses, stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs), large deviation theory, and random matrix theory. This gathering will lead to cross-fertilization between these areas as well as inspire and inform a new generation of researchers. This event will attract a large and diverse spectrum of participants, including many earlier career researchers, women and under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>Many of the complex systems which will be discussed in this conference aim to describe real world phenomena and results proved for the mathematical models provide predictions applicable to the real systems. At a simpler level, think, for instance, of how the central limit theorem for sums of independent random variables predicts the Gaussian statistics which drives a large part of statistics in the real world.

Greenville, SC obtains the bulk of its drinking water from a well-protected reservoir that is situated in the middle of a forest that is currently heavily damaged by ongoing forest fires that just got under control within the past week. With the ensuing seasonal rains, much of the burned material will enter the streams that supply water to this large, metropolitan city. Our aims in this project are to access the changes that the forest fire has on the hydrology and water quality of this important reservoir. We will compare hydrological, biological and chemical differences between streams impacted by fire and those that have not been impacted to evaluate if these extreme events affect the quality of our drinking water. We will combine new hydrological models and next generation molecular tools with standard chemical measurements to investigate these differences. An engineering graduate student that is helping to develop the hydrological model will also be cross-trained in these latest microbiological and statistical techniques. Our assessment will be an important step in understanding what impacts forest fires may have on water quality in other areas of the US. <br/>The objective of this project is to collect perishable water quality related data to determine how the current combination of climate extremes such as droughts and subsequent wildfire events affect a pristine watershed in South Carolina in terms of its hydrology, water quality, and microbial community composition and structure. Specifically, we will address the following:<br/>a) How does the water quality change within a watershed following fire? How much water quality change is controlled by change in watershed conditions (altered landscape and changing hydrology) vs changes in stream internal processes? and<br/>b) We will evaluate the consequences of drought - wildfire regime specifically after the destruction of the vegetation cover and the subsequent alteration of spatial soil properties (e.g., infiltration) and geomorphic features on runoff and sediment loads in a pristine watershed based on the pre-fire and the post-fire conditions.<br/>We will assess the influence of wildfires on stream water quality, for example, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, heavy metals and ammonium; taxon richness (alpha diversity) and the structure and composition of microbial communities. We will utilize next-generation sequencing to assess the microbial communities and statistically compare differences in water quality as assessed by these molecular and chemical assays to streams not impacted by forest fires. With these experiments we hope to quantify the major controls on post-fire water quality as well as the internal stream processes that mitigate stream water quality. These data will enable stream water quality recovery times to be better characterized and will directly impact how the post-fire watershed should be managed as a public water supply. This research will inform stakeholders (e.g., Greenville water system) about the possible impacts of wildfire on water quality and take necessary steps such as green technology to help mitigate any debris run-off and/or any stream siltation from the burned areas of the watershed. These research findings can be applied to other areas of the U.S. due to current and expected future combinations of drought and wildfire events.","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1722482","Barbara","Campbell","bcampb7@clemson.edu","01/04/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Clemson University","CLEMSON","296340001","8646562424","230 Kappa Street","United States","South Carolina","SC","1579","HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ashok","Mishra","ashokm@clemson.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Derived algebraic geometry is an increasingly active mathematical area that combines approaches from a number of established fields (including algebraic geometry, topology, and mathematical physics), and the conference location is a major center for work in this subject. Funds will support the travel and local expenses of junior researchers; accordingly, the direct impact will be the training and career development of 10 or more early-career US mathematicians, who will gain the opportunity to participate in a workshop in this subject, communicate their research results, and further develop collaborations with emerging research groups in Europe. Conference speakers and participants from outside of the United States will be supported by the German national research foundation (DFG) through the grants SFB-1085 and SPP-1786.<br/><br/>In the past fifteen years, we have seen the rapid development of the field of derived algebraic geometry. Because it draws threads and inspiration from algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and even mathematical physics, this field has attracted a large number of early-career researchers. This conference will bring together international experts from algebraic topology, homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry, and related areas, and the focus of the conference will be current work and emerging ideas in the field, using the existence and applications of dualities as a theme. Throughout algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, the existence of a theory of duality reveals deep structure about the objects under study. Basic examples include Poincare duality for manifolds or Serre duality for varieties, but these are expressions of much more general phenomena best studied in the derived setting. There has been significant recent progress in derived algebraic geometry, in both theory and computations. It is the aim of this conference both to consolidate these advances and to promote new research directions.<br/><br/>Conference webpage:<br/>http://www-cgi.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/MAT/sfb-higher-invariants/index.php/SpringSchool2017","01/04/2017","01/04/2017","1700795","Vesna","Stojanoska","vesna@illinois.edu","01/04/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1267","TOPOLOGY","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Paul","Goerss","pgoerss@math.northwestern.edu","01/04/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The conference features seventeen plenary speakers, eight of whom are from the US, and 21 workshops where the junior participants participants will be able to present a talk or a poster.<br/><br/>The impact of constantly increasing computational power has changed the relationship between mathematics and computation. New applications such as encryption, large scale data management, and signal/image processing, inevitably led to the study of the computational tools themselves, creating and reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines. Mathematicians now increasingly recognize that, besides its value as a numerical and experimental tool, computation is a significant theoretical tool in its own right. This conference aims to further the understanding of the connections between mathematics and computation, including the interfaces between pure and applied mathematics, numerical analysis and computer science. This is reflected in the diverse and vibrant research areas covered by the 21 workshops which are organized by world experts, including many from the US.

The Householder symposium is the premier meeting in the field of numerical linear algebra and participation in this symposium is by application and invitation only. The symposium places a strong emphasis on supporting early-career scientists and the intermingling of such scientists with the leading experts in the field. The support of young researchers will enhance the continued leadership of the US in this crucial discipline and its application to technologies that greatly benefit society. Advances and applications of numerical linear algebra are fundamental for handling large data sets with applications crossing web searches, medical imaging, scientific simulations, all high performance computing applications, and the design of both materials and structures.<br/><br/>Google's PageRank algorithm is a smart combination of methods from two numerical linear algebra fields, Perron-Frobenius theory/Markov chains and eigenvalue solvers. Similarly, deriving crucial information from today's giant data sets, which dwarf anything encountered before, whether from business, government, or the sensors in new medical imaging equipment, relies on substantial innovations to a core numerical linear algebra method, the singular value decomposition. Finally, ensuring efficient simulations on the next generation of supercomputers to assess the continued safety of the nation's nuclear weapons requires drastic changes to linear solvers, another ubiquitous numerical linear algebra method.

Kuech","Several materials of technological importance require high temperature processing over long durations and thus demand a large cost and energy footprint. Electromagnetic waves such as microwave radiation and lasers can lower both temperatures and times involved in processing various types of materials, ranging from cooking food, making pharmaceutical drugs and 3D printed plastic parts to applications in precision surgery. What is common to all these examples is the idea that the electromagnetic fields absorbed within a material may not be immediately converted to heat, but can instead promote other forms of chemical or physical reactions. This grant provides funding to organize an inaugural two-day workshop to foster collaboration between the research communities that use electromagnetic fields (in particular microwave radiation and lasers) for making materials. This workshop will generate discussions and cross-pollinate ideas between members of both communities addressing longstanding scientific challenges in using electromagnetic fields for materials synthesis/processing. From an industrial standpoint, technological advances in processing advanced materials using electromagnetic fields can have a smaller energy footprint compared to conventional synthesis and as such will have a profound impact on society. These materials will additionally find use in diverse areas like sustainable infrastructure, transportation, clean energy, water management, and healthcare. <br/><br/>This workshop will foster collaborations between the research communities that use electromagnetic fields, particularly microwave radiation and lasers for materials synthesis. A grand challenge common to both communities is that the fundamental mechanisms behind far-from-equilibrium, non-thermal chemical and phase transformations under electromagnetic excitation remain largely unknown. For example, the low temperature crystallization and sintering of ceramics by both microwave radiation and lasers (e.g., pulsed laser annealing) has been reported and are potential non-thermal effects of significant industrial importance, as conventional synthetic routes even under the same thermal profile cannot reproduce the results. Accordingly, specific focus during the invited talks and break-out discussion sessions will be placed on examining (1) theoretical models, (2) experimental tools, (3) in-situ and in-operando characterization techniques, and (4) computational methods to identify and prove the existence of far-from-equilibrium effects under electromagnetic fields and apply them for rational design of materials. The continuing goal will be to establish a multidisciplinary community spanning experimental and theoretical/computational research groups by organizing regular meetings, initiating collaborations, and conceiving transformative research proposals that will lead to answers to the longstanding questions in the field.","01/05/2017","01/05/2017","1719800","B.

Madsen","NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Metal oxide-based gas sensing today goes beyond pollution control and environmental monitoring and reaches out to health monitoring applications and non-invasive diagnostics. Therefore, a broader scope of understanding is needed to synthesize and use metal oxides for detecting a specific chemical at trace concentrations with no interference from other compounds in a complex mixture. Within this project, the structure (rather than the composition) of an oxide is being correlated to its ability to detect a specific vapor of interest, whether it is a disease marker in breath or a harmful pollutant in the environment. The experiments being undertaken include novel synthesis of ceramic phases at the nanoscale, and atomic level characterization of gas-oxide interactions. Fundamental knowledge about how to produce tailored ceramic nanostructures with high specificity to the chemical vapors of interest is sought. This project is training scientists to use advanced materials processing and characterization techniques, and is educating the public at large about the benefits of ceramics research to human health and welfare. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: While semiconducting metal oxides have been used as resistive gas sensors commercially since 1968, the nature of gas-oxide interactions still remains unknown. These inherently polymorphic ceramics exist in various distinct crystallographic configurations, each behaving as a different material with respect to it?s physical and chemical properties, even though they all have the exact same composition. Nanoscale processing of ceramics has made available a ""toolbox"" of ""metastable phases"" at room temperature in high quantities. Sensing elements based on nanostructured binary metal oxides of controlled stoichiometry and phase distribution need to be studied in order to elucidate how gas selectivity is achieved. The underlying hypothesis is that phase distribution, rather than oxide composition, determines the gas sensing properties. Therefore, this study is synthesizing such controlled nanostructures, single crystal nanowires and nanopowders of both stable and metastable phases for common oxides used in sensing (MoO3, WO3, TiO2) by means of blend electrospinning, soft chemistry routes, and a rapid solidification process; and then carrying out detailed characterization studies on gas-oxide interactions, including in situ gas sensing experiments in an electron microscope. The physico-chemical changes occurring on the oxide surfaces in contact with a given gas (e.g., oxidation, reduction, ferroelectric poling) will be assessed for a selected group of oxide crystals (rutile, perovskite, etc.) and a respective set of classes of chemicals (such as amines and alkanes). The expected outcome from this project is a gas-oxide polymorph selection library for building the next generation of gas-sensing systems with inherent selectivity, to be used in health monitoring as non-invasive diagnostics.","01/05/2017","01/05/2017","1724455","Pelagia","Gouma","pelagia.gouma@uta.edu","01/05/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Arlington","Arlington","760190145","8172722105","1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT","United States","Texas","TX","7222","XC-Crosscutting Activities Pro","1515","MINORITY GRADUATE EDUC ACTIVIT","7209","NEXT GEN CHEM & BIO SENSORS & SENSING SY","7234","SENSORS NON-SOLICITATION RESEA","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","9161","SINGLE DIVISION/UNIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1253",NA,NA,NA,"OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How do these stars die? Astronomers use SNe as 'standard candles', because they are all shown to explode with nearly identical energies. If the energy of an explosion is constant, then the fainter the SNe is seen, the more distant it must be. Astronomers use these SNe to measure the distance to galaxies. Because of their great brightness, SNe are astronomers best tool for studying dark matter at great distances. However there are some serious concerns; do stars with different element composition or spin explode with different brightness? How do the details of star systems and explosion physics influence our understanding of dark energy? <br/><br/>SNe have been one of the driving forces behind some of the most interesting physics of the past century: black holes, neutron stars, dark energy, neutrinos, and cosmic rays.

The team will use these coupled codes to create a library of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, evolving, and merging galaxies. They will then fold the resulting models through estimates of cosmological merger rates and merging histories obtained through semi-analytic and numerical methods. This strategy will make it possible to connect physical mechanisms operating on scales of tens of parsecs to observations from large-scale galaxy surveys. The goals of the project are (1) to construct a physically motivated unified model for the diverse ""zoo"" of high redshift galaxies, including galaxy populations expected to be discovered in deep surveys by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Herschel Space Telescope; (2) to assess the cosmological significance of the various high redshift galaxy populations, and determine the dominant contributors to cosmic stellar mass assembly and the far infrared background; and (3) to develop tools for observers based on a physical understanding of high-redshift galaxies and a critical assessment of the applicability of locally-calibrated diagnostics. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, who will be mentored and trained by the Principal Investigator. The proposers will make public for the community expected luminosity functions for ALMA, JWST and Herschel deep fields in advance of these surveys. They will also conduct a series of 1-hour lectures as part of a continuing education program for senior citizens.","01/06/2017","01/06/2017","1724864","Desika","Narayanan","desika.narayanan@ufl.edu","01/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","1217","EXTRAGALACTIC ASTRON & COSMOLO","0000","UNASSIGNED","1206","THEORETICAL & COMPUTATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS","OTHR","OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many projects seek to improve mathematics instruction, but are not able to easily track their efforts at improvement. The primary product of this project will be a system of practical measures and routines for collecting and using data that both assesses and supports the implementation of rigorous instructional materials in middle-grades mathematics. In contrast to research and accountability measures, practical measures are assessments that require little time to administer and can thus be used frequently. The data can be analyzed rapidly so that teachers can receive prompt feedback on their progress, and instructional leaders can use the data to decide where to target resources to support improvement in the quality of instruction and student learning. The system of practical measures and routines will include 1) measures of high-leverage aspects of teachers' instructional practices that have been linked to student learning (e.g., rigor of tasks, quality of students' discourse) and attend to equitable student participation; and 2) measures of high-leverage aspects of key supports for improving the quality of teachers' practice (e.g., quality of professional development; coaching); and 3) a set of routines regarding how to use the resulting data to engage in rapid, improvement efforts. A key principle of the proposed project is that the system of measures and routines can be adapted to a wide range of school and district contexts. This project is supported by the Discovery Research preK-12 (DRK-12) program. The DRK-12 program supports research and development of STEM education innovations and approaches in assessment, learning, and teaching. <br/><br/>The project will establish three research-practice partnerships with five districts, in three different states, that are currently implementing rigorous instructional materials in middle-grades mathematics. Year 1 will focus on the development of a set of practical measures of classroom instruction. Year 2 will focus on testing the use of the classroom measures in the context of supports for teachers' learning, and the development of practical measures of key supports for teachers' learning. Years 3-4 will focus on how the project can ""learn our way to scale"" (Bryk et al., 2015), which requires strategically implementing measures and routines in increasingly diverse conditions. The project will engage in rapid improvement cycles in which researchers will work alongside district leaders and professional development (PD) facilitators to analyze the data from the measures of both classroom instruction and the quality of support for teacher learning to test the effectiveness of improvements in intended supports for teacher learning and to adjust the design of the support based on data. Across Years 1-4, the project will use recent developments in technology and information visualization to test and improve 1) the collection of practical measures in situ and 2) the design of data representations (or visualizations) that support teachers and leaders to make instructional improvement decisions. In Year 5, the project will conduct formal analyses of the relations between supports for teachers' learning; teachers' knowledge and classroom practices; and student learning.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1719744","June","Ahn","juneahn@umd.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator","New York University","NEW YORK","100121019","2129982121","70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S","United States","New York","NY","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7980",NA,NA,NA,"Core R&D Programs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study uses a multidisciplinary approach (paleontology, paleoecology, comparative anatomy, experimental biology) to ask questions about how extinct populations of hominins behaved on their natural landscapes. Specifically, the investigators will analyze lower jaws (mandibles), among the most commonly represented parts of the skeleton in the early human fossil record, of modern great apes and two early species of extinct hominins (Autralopithecus), to understand how the structure of the mandible is related to changes in feeding behavior and diet. The research will provide new data about how changes in diet and feeding behavior transformed our anatomy across time, permitting more robust explanations of the processes by which we became human. Broader impacts will include undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in the latest analytical techniques for fossil analyses; outreach to primary and secondary school science teachers and students using hands-on experiences and web-based content designed to enhance teaching and learning about human origins; and the production of a unique collection 3D data for modern apes and rare fossil specimens that will be available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>Mandibles are the most common element in the hominin fossil record after teeth; they are used to diagnose species, test phylogenetic hypotheses, and infer feeding behavior and diet. However, extensive theoretical and experimental work on extant primates has not clarified which aspects of variation in mandibular form are related to variation in the positions of the tooth row, jaw muscles and jaw joint, which are related to the mandible's resistance to internal forces, and how these relate to feeding behavior and diet. Furthermore, the classical consensus on the relationship between dentognathic morphology and diet in Plio-Pleistocene hominins - adaptation to processing mechanically resistant foods - has been challenged by recent inferences from dietary isotopes, occlusal microwear, and finite element modeling, which do not converge on a shared view of early hominin diets and feeding behavior. This lack of consensus is especially glaring in light of the rich fossil record of mandibles for the Australopithecus anamensis-A. afarensis lineage (4.2-3.0 Ma), which documents clear changes in dentognathic morphology and carbon-isotope signatures over time. The primary focus of the proposed research is an integrative investigation of how spatial and mechanical determinants of mandibular form track change in diet and feeding behavior in extant hominids (great apes and humans) and early Australopithecus. The research is organized under three specific aims: 1. Quantifying and comparing the location, magnitude and nature of external and internal morphological variation in mandibles of extant (Homo, Pongo, Pan, and Gorilla) and fossil (A. anamensis, A. afarensis) hominids via computed tomography and geometric morphometrics; 2. Testing specific hypotheses about the biomechanical significance of variation in hominid mandibular morphology via finite-element models; and 3. Evaluating the extent to which spatial positioning of masticatory system components (tooth row, jaw joint, and muscle attachment points) explain variation in mandibular morphology across extant hominids and early Australopithecus. The project will provide new data on the structural and functional determinants of early hominin mandibular morphology, to help identify the factors that drove these morphological changes and allow tests of adaptive hypotheses about the early evolution of the genus.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1723041","Andrea","Taylor","andrea.taylor3@tu.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator","Touro College","New York","100184502","6465656026","500 7th Avenue","United States","New York","NY","1392","Biological Anthropology","1392","Biological Anthropology","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As computing devices have become ubiquitous and permeated every aspect of life, the need for greater performance has also followed. However, traditional design techniques to enable high performance microprocessors incur resource costs and typically suffer from poor energy efficiency. These overheads come at a considerable cost as most embedded designs are energy constrained and highly cost sensitive. The byproduct of these competing design constraints has been stagnating progress due to the ineffectiveness of traditional techniques. Through the use of this project's novel processor microarchitecture, commercial designs should observe approximately 30% greater energy efficiency and superior performance without incurring resource overhead. Applications such as networking and storage domains are initial candidates for adopting the design.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on the creation of an energy-efficient microcontroller through the use of a novel processor microarchitecture. At the time most fundamental microprocessor techniques were developed, power was not a problem and transistors were scarce. To satisfy these constraints, designs focused on maximizing utilization of the few execution resources present. As transistors became more plentiful and performance of greater importance, designs utilized these additional transistors to enable complex organizational and scheduling techniques to maximize the operation of the scarce execution resources. This project's architecture reverses this trend by allocating additional transistors to execution resources and greatly simplifying organizational and scheduling overheads. Initial research suggests that considerable energy and area efficiency gains are possible while maintaining a high level of performance in comparison to current commercial designs. Additionally, the novel structure of this microprocessor enables many optimizations that are impractical in conventional designs due to their complex organization and scheduling.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1720263","Mikko","Lipasti","mikko@engr.wisc.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Wisconsin-Madison","MADISON","537151218","6082623822","21 North Park Street","United States","Wisconsin","WI","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yellen","Shawn Lambert, of the University of Oklahoma, examines prehistoric Native American Caddo pottery at mound centers in the Arkansas River Basin to investigate the ritual mode of production and distribution. The goal is to understand early social interactions between two diverse areas of the Caddo region. Archaeology is well positioned to research the relationships between emerging social complexity in small communities and their capacity to develop long-distance exchange networks that can persist for hundreds of years. In much of the developing world today small communities are knit into larger regional entities by exchange of goods which serve to forge social relations. Thus understanding underlying principles of linkage and how they are reflected in physical objects provides a valuable tool for discerning social organization. Recent archaeological studies have emphasized that communities with an emerging organizational complexity were engaged in large-scale production and distribution of highly valued pottery. The interaction fostered by communities who produced and distributed them created new social networks and long-term relationships, and influenced the historical trajectories of an entire region. From A.D. 800 - 1150, the inhabitants of the Arkansas River Basin built earthen mound centers that became important places on the Caddo landscape for ritual and mortuary activities. Formative Caddo pottery that had powerful symbolic meanings was brought to these mound centers and used strictly for mortuary purposes. However, their southern Caddo neighbors produced them in larger numbers and were used for a variety of domestic and ceremonial purposes. This suggests an extensive history of centralized production and long distance distribution of some of the most distinctive pottery known in North America. This study will have major implications for how we understand the origins and spread of pottery in prehistoric communities. <br/><br/>This research is designed to identify the geographic locales and intensity of Formative Caddo pottery production and distribution and whether or not it led to meet the demands for long-distance exchange and mortuary use at Arkansas Basin mound centers. To better understand the ritual and social importance of the production and distribution of this pottery, this project employs two types of analysis. First, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) will be conducted at the University of Missouri Research Reactor laboratory (MURR) to characterize the chemical makeup of Formative Caddo pottery in the Arkansas River Basin. INAA will also be used on locally made ceramics from the Arkansas River Basin to create clay reference groups. Comparing these results with previously generated INAA data of the southern Caddo region will allow the researchers to determine the geographic origins of pottery recovered at Arkansas Basin ceremonial sites. Second, in order to turn this project into a historical narrative, it is necessary to have better chronological sensitivity through AMS dating techniques. Annual plants and charcoal samples will be sent to the University of Arizona AMS Laboratory. These samples will be chosen when their contexts are directly associated with the pottery that are used for INAA in order to explore the direct relationships of these communities for historical continuity or change within the Formative Caddo period.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1702373","Shawn","Lambert","splambert@ou.edu","01/09/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Oklahoma Norman Campus","NORMAN","730199705","4053254757","201 Stephenson Parkway","United States","Oklahoma","OK","7606","DDRI Archaeology","1391","ARCHAEOLOGY","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patrick","Livingood","patrickl@ou.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Frontiers are universally important in representing the spatial limits of modern and ancient states but can change considerably over time: from ambiguous and permeable to rigidly controlled and divisive. But how may political power on frontiers evolve over time and what factors may lead to different outcomes? Focusing on frontier conflict through defensive architecture, this study contributes to understandings of the long-term consequences of fortifications and border walls along political frontiers. Additionally, a landscape perspective highlights the importance of certain natural (i.e. mineral deposits, water sources, farmland) and human-made (i.e. canals, trade routes, population centers) features in determining where political power may be expressed or contested on the landscape. By shedding light on long-term causes and consequences of frontier political involvement and conflict, this project resonates well with some particular challenges faced by many modern states, like the US, in border maintenance and military action. The results and data from this project will be available in the Comparative Archaeological Database for open-access use by the broader scientific community and will be a key part of a larger regional digitization initiative called the Moche Valley Ancient Settlement Database. Finally, following a collaborative research program, this project will train Peruvian and American students in several new archaeological techniques (i.e. aerial drone mapping) while actively integrating local people with the practice of archaeological research during several workshops and public presentations of the survey results.<br/><br/>Through archaeological survey of the Upper Moche Valley frontier in northern Peru, this project compares the frontiers of two sequential polities, the Southern Moche State (AD 200-900) and the Chimu Empire (AD 900-1470), in order to understand how political power may evolve in frontier landscapes. Although the Chimu arguably rose from the ashes of the Moche in the lower valley, the Southern Moche State was an earlier ""first-generation"" polity with far more indirect methods of rule than the centralized and expansive Chimu. As their eastern frontier, the Upper Moche Valley was attractive to both polities, crucially providing canal intakes and an exchange corridor with the metal-rich highlands. Meanwhile, a plethora of prehistoric forts and defensively located or walled towns in the region point towards it being a highly contested frontier. But how did the Moche and Chimu frontiers differ in this region? And how did the involvement of these states in the frontier evolve over time? This project will address these questions by highlighting the interacting roles of (1) the qualities of a state itself, (2) the intensity and organization of frontier conflict, and (3) the use of natural and human-made landscape features. Project methodology integrates traditional full-coverage survey and controlled surface collection with cutting-edge aerial imagery and 3-D site models attained through quad-copter drone mapping. Combined into a geographic database these data will be used to reconstruct regional settlement, political boundaries, and defensive networks to understand the evolution of the Upper Moche frontier.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1719283","Elizabeth","Arkush","arkush@pitt.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Pittsburgh","Pittsburgh","152132303","4126247400","University Club","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7606","DDRI Archaeology","1391","ARCHAEOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patrick","Mullins","pjm87@pitt.edu","01/09/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The novel form factor for 3D electromagnetic energy storage and confinement could enable breakthrough applications for consumer electronics, smart cities, and the Internet of Things. If successful, this technology can revolutionize the market for high frequency low noise system-on-chip, portable communication devices at 5G and beyond, and wearable electronics, power electronics, wireless sensors for medical imaging and positioning, and wireless body area networks.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM) nanotechnology for extreme miniaturization of passive electronic devices and components. It provides a novel fabrication pathway for realizing devices in 3D that are extremely small and light, with significantly enhanced functionalities. The overarching principle of S-RuM nanotechnology is strain-driven spontaneous deformation of 2D membranes into 3D architectures. For coil inductors, instead of spiraling the metal wires in plane to increase the inductance, the S-RuM inductors have the metal wires spiraling normal to surface, which naturally minimizes the in-plane footprint. The ultra-small enclosed footprint inevitably enables high frequency operation because of the minimum overlap capacitance with the substrate. Much higher inductance can be achieved because of the strong positive mutual coupling between the turns. In particular, on-chip 3D radio frequency (RF) /microwave/millimeter wave passive devices can be realized that are 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those fabricated with conventional CMOS-compatible 2D processes.","01/09/2017","01/09/2017","1722234","Xiuling","Li","xiuling@uiuc.edu","01/09/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) are extremely dangerous and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Patients with catheters are significantly more likely to develop an infection than those without a catheter. With an average cost of approximately $45k per patient, CLABSI are the most expensive hospital associated infection to treat. Hospitals spend an estimated $1.38 billion treating inpatient infections due to central lines, and Medicare and insurance companies spend an additional $1.7 billion treating outpatient infections from central line catheters in dialysis patients. More broadly, market opportunities for the technology include: sterilization of urinary tract catheters, prevention of catheter based infections in multi-trauma patients such as military personnel, and wound infection treatment.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial potential for an antimicrobial wound dressing that exploits the bactericidal effect of blue light to inactivate bacteria commonly colonizing the surface of catheters. The light-emitting catheter dressing is designed to be easily integrated with current standards of care to reduce central line associated blood stream infections. Blue light activates photosensitizers in bacteria, which release reactive oxygen species that are highly cytotoxic by damage of proteins and DNA. Blue light is significantly less harmful to mammalian cells as compared to ultraviolet irradiation, which is commonly used for disinfection of medical facilities, medical devices, water and food. Increasing rates of bacterial resistance indicate the need for infection treatment methods that do not require the use drugs.

Biotechnology industry spends over $35 billion/year on research and development world-wide. However, the current R&D process mainly relies on manual work of highly experienced research scientists. Such manual operation is slow, expensive, and prone to human errors, which has constrained the growth of this industry. The application of such fully automated and highly versatile biofoundry may help biotech companies greatly expedite their R&D and reduce the cost. Thus, the risk of R&D can be further reduced to enable the development of more bio-based specialty chemicals, fuels, pollution remediation, as well as healthcare products for the market. Initial work suggest the biofoundry technology may have an initial opportunity in the strain development market for fermentation companies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to study the specific markets for the advanced biomanufacturing technologies. The first prototype of such a robotic platform has demonstrated its throughput and versatility in the proof-of-concept studies. It is capable of conducting most molecular and cellular biology experiments with minimal human intervention. With its modular hardware and software systems, this platform can be rapidly reconfigured to a variety of tasks for engineering biological systems. The modular system architecture also allows programming of long and complex workflows that were very difficult to implement in previous lab automation systems. When used for assembling complex DNA molecules, it achieved a throughput of over 400 constructs/day with close to 100% success rate. Such throughput and consistency was unattainable by conventional manual operations.

The use of high levels of pure noble metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium in existing commercial catalysts are increasingly unsustainable in many aspects, including high price, noble metal scarcity, low recycling recovery, and limited global supply, posing significant challenges to catalyst manufacturing. Manufacturing low-cost and efficient catalysts for commercial applications in emission control systems will enable more cost effective adherence to clean air and other environmental regulations. The low-noble metal content catalysts are anticipated to reduce the content of noble metals in the catalysts in comparison with existing catalysts in many emission control systems, reducing the cost of emission control systems. There is a clear market potential for the catalyst technology in view of the expectation of the global market of emission control system catalysts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on customer discovery in the translation of a new catalyst technology to commercial production of low-noble-metal-content catalysts for emission control systems. Noble metals such as palladium and platinum are widely used in the catalysts for emission control systems, including factory exhaust gas treatment reactors and catalytic converters, to meet the ever-tightening of emission standards, calling for further reduction of emission levels of the criteria gaseous pollutants. However, the high costs and market volatility risks associated with the platinum group metals constitute a major area of pain in the market of emission control systems. To address this challenge, the proposed low-noble-metal-content catalysts feature noble metals alloyed with non-noble transition metals in nano-alloy and composite formulations, which exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and stability for the elimination reactions of the pollutants at significantly reduced use of noble metals in comparison with existing catalysts in the commercial emission control systems.

A prominent example is that of birds. Taking to the air enabled the dinosaurian ancestors of birds to exploit a range of ecological niches that now underlie the remarkable modern diversity of the group (approximately 10,000 living species). A significant part of this evolutionary success may have stemmed from the development of a relatively large brain, which has been considered necessary for coordinating the various, nuanced components of powered flight. This study complements the NSF BRAIN initiative by using a cross-disciplinary approach to understand the complex neurological evolution of birds and their dinosaurian relatives. To that end, an array of new techniques and new applications of existing technologies are employed to document the major changes in the brain associated with the origin of powered flight. This study also will establish a model of brain expansion complementing that already available for mammals. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of avian brain anatomy that includes not only imagery of morphological systems but also their relation to data generated through brain function. <br/><br/>The relationship between neuroanatomical, cognitive and behavioral evolution remains poorly understood, especially in deep time and across the vertebrate tree of life. This study addresses this relationship using a cross-disciplinary investigation of the evolutionary link between the large brain of living birds and the morphological changes that mark the transition from cursorial (running) dinosaur to flying bird. Initial steps use innovative imaging methods and novel staining techniques to generate the first data on what areas of the brain birds use while flying, and how this activity differs from that of other behaviors. These data will serve as a framework for a broad analysis of encephalization (increasing head size) within living birds and along the lineage where avian flight originated. Shared landmarks will be used to subdivide the endocranial cavity into functionally relevant partitions that allow testing for volumetric size changes between individual neural structures, including those most active during flight. This study also will use geometric morphometrics (anatomical comparisons) to assess covariation between neuroanatomical partitions and thus the presence of functionally and/or evolutionarily integrated regions of the brain. In short, the proposed study will generate data on how birds use their brain and apply those data to better understand the ancient relationship between brain evolution and the origin of the highly derived avian body plan.","01/10/2017","01/10/2017","1724357","Gaberiel","Bever","gbever@nyit.edu","01/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Johns Hopkins University","Baltimore","212182608","4105168668","3400 N CHARLES ST","United States","Maryland","MD","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This award supports a research effort aimed at defining a platform that replaces current best-practice techniques with those responsive to the scalability, throughput, yield and cost-effectiveness requirements of nanomanufacturing. If the nanomanufacturing platform is validated it could act as the synthetic foundation underpinning for: (i) sensor technologies able to detect various cancers, E. coli, explosives, drugs and heavy metal contaminents, (ii) catalytic surfaces geared towards environmental remediation or ""green"" chemical syntheses powered by sunlight and (iii) a new class of photovoltaics reliant on plasmonic materials.

Unfortunately, creating good news visualizations is a difficult and labor-intensive task that involves numerous complex decisions. A designer must identify data relevant to the article, clean the data, generate the visualization (a complex process on its own), and provide annotations to connect the article and visualization. While some design guidelines have been developed, many decisions are based on designer intuition, a process that is not scalable to the thousands of news articles that are published every day. This project seeks to build intelligent tools to help designers more quickly create good news visualizations and to develop systems that generate news visualizations autonomously. This research project will enhance citizen understanding of complex information in the news and improve numerical, graphical, and geography literacy. Additionally, the research will provide support for new job categories (e.g., data scientists, computational journalists, data analysts, etc.) and existing companies (e.g., online media, search engines, etc.) in their evolution to new interactive platforms. The research results will be integrated into a broad set of widely accessible educational materials for a variety of courses (visualization, spatial computing, and text analysis) and will serve as research and practical training for undergraduates, graduates, and professionals. <br/><br/>Providing a scalable solution to automatically generating contextually-relevant visualizations requires the understanding and encoding of the design process. Specifically, the goals of this project are (a) identifying the decision process of visualization designers, (b) creating automated components that operationalize these decisions including text processing, searching through a wide range of heterogeneous data sources and datasets (e.g. census data, stock market data, government macroeconomic data), and automatic visualization construction and annotation, and (c) ranking of the visualizations based on well-known quantitative metrics from information retrieval and information visualization such as relevance, expressiveness, and effectiveness. By extracting key comparisons from an article's text through the use of natural language processing and using existing visualization-article pairs as an evaluation corpus, the system will ensure that relevant datasets are found and that the selected visual forms preserve and enhance the information conveyed in the article. For example, the system will automatically create thematic maps for geospatial comparisons of population change in the U.S. and time series for longitudinal comparisons of company financial results. Although the focus of this work in on the news domain, the research can be extended to other application areas including textbooks, internal company reports, and more generally, to any texts that implicitly or explicitly correspond to quantitative data.

The conventional means of synthesizing nanoparticles is generally inefficient and produces waste materials that are not easily recyclable. This award supports fundamental research on the chemical and physical reactions in plasma electrolysis to obtain knowledge that will enable efficient manufacture of nanoparticles. Plasma electrolysis is a glow discharge (like Neon light) in contact with liquid. The plasma is confined around an electrode by the liquid electrolyte, leading to very high energy density. This high-density plasma facilitates effective formation of nanoparticles from the working electrode. This research will benefit the scientific community by advancing knowledge about plasma physics and chemistry at liquid-gas-solid interfaces. Using cost-effective nanoparticles in photovoltaic devices and batteries will greatly promote the efficiency of clean energy generation and storage. The technologies that emerge from this research will not only promote US competitiveness in nanomaterials manufacturing, but will also ensure a sustainable economy and address global environmental concerns. This research will strengthen interdisciplinary research, education, and training in nanomaterials science and plasma physics by engaging college and high school students, thereby increasing the participation of underrepresented groups and expanding the pool of skilled workers.<br/><br/>Plasma electrolysis can be a rapid and efficient process for nanoparticle manufacturing. All previous studies indicate that plasma electrolysis tends to create large particles (microns) and irregular electrode surface morphology. This has led to the conventional belief that multiple chemical and physical reactions occur simultaneously and that physical reactions dominate plasma electrolysis. Very little is known about the chemical reactions. To fill this knowledge gap and realize the full potential of plasma electrolysis for nanoparticle manufacturing, the research team will 1) establish a particle-fluid hybrid model to describe the physical and chemical reactions in plasma electrolysis; 2) use in-situ optical emission spectroscopy to verify the plasma reactions and the modeling results; 3) decouple the physical and chemical reactions to test the hypothesis that the electrolyte composition determines gas evolution (bubbles or a continuous layer), which governs discharge characteristics and the dominant plasma reactions; and 4) establish the relationships between plasma electrolysis parameters (electrolyte composition, magnetic field, and discharge power) and nanoparticle morphology.","01/10/2017","01/10/2017","1700787","Qi","Fan","qfan@egr.msu.edu","01/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1788","NANOMANUFACTURING","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC","084E","NANOMANUFACTURING","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After analysis of the survey's results, a larger group of scientists and representatives from professional organizations will meet to reach consensus on the most important obstacles to students pursuing careers in ecology and evolutionary biology, and to propose new ways of assisting those students. This work is important because advancement of science depends on a diverse workforce to provide novel ideas that would remain undiscovered if all scientists had similar backgrounds.<br/><br/>Previous research to understand the low participation of blacks in ecology and evolutionary biology suggests they have higher levels of religiosity than other underrepresented groups and that their reluctance may also hinge on misconceptions about evolution. The principal investigators (PIs) of this project hypothesize that lack of role models, lack of experience working in the outdoors, and cultural factors (e.g., religious beliefs, values) are barriers to inclusion, lowering blacks' sense of identity and belonging in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. To test this hypothesis, the PIs have developed a survey to assess the roles these factors play in shaping attitudes of undergraduate students to careers in different disciplines of science. Participants at a small initial workshop will rigorously review and assess the efficacy of the survey.

Pollington","The University of Tennessee at Knoxville will host the fall meeting of the Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) in September of 2017. The local organizers will be Luis Finotti and Marie Jameson. The second meeting will be hosted at Clemson University at the beginning of December; local organizers will be Jim Brown, Kevin James, and Hui Xue. The third meeting of the year, the Southeastern Regional Meeting on Numbers (SERMON), is tentatively scheduled to be held in April 2018 at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee with local organizer Rodney Keaton. While ETSU has expressed enthusiasm for hosting the meeting, the meeting location of SERMON is traditionally decided at the previous year's SERMON meeting. Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available. The conferences slated for 2017 will be the 28th and 29th meetings of the Palmetto Number Theory Series (http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html). PANTS is a series of number theory conferences that was founded in 2006 and is managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the two flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The 31st meeting of the Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/) will be held in spring 2018. SERMON is a larger regional meeting founded in 1988; SERMON rotates to schools in a larger geographical region than PANTS. Recent meetings of SERMON have averaged 40 - 60 participants. PANTS and SERMON consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each PANTS meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. SERMON in spring 2018 will feature exclusively contributed talks. <br/><br/>The Palmetto Number Theory Series and the Southeastern Regional Meeting on Numbers provide the Southeastern number theory community with a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in number theory. Students and junior faculty play a prominent role in the meetings both through delivering talks as well as by forming research collaborations to others in the region as well as plenary speakers. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds. The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities.","01/10/2017","01/10/2017","1701290","Frank","Thorne","thorne@math.sc.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Clemson University","CLEMSON","296340001","8646562424","230 Kappa Street","United States","South Carolina","SC","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matthew","Boylan","boylan@math.sc.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hui","Xue","huixue@clemson.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","James","Brown","jimlb@g.clemson.edu","01/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kevin","James","kevja@clemson.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the recognition of their valuable services, local land use and global climate change are driving the loss of coastal wetlands. This project will advance our understanding of coastal wetland structure and function, while answering questions relevant to management that can help prevent wetland loss. This project will determine the capacity of North Carolina coastal wetlands to continue to provide ecosystem services under a changing climate. The project will engage middle school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and citizen scientists in long-term ecological research by creating new curricula, field based exercises, a graduate course, and a citizen science mobile device application. The project will support three graduate students, five undergraduate students, and four middle school teachers over five years. The project will also advance the career of a young investigator that is a member of an underrepresented group. <br/><br/>This research will adapt recently developed methods to identify 'early warning signals' that will indicate the resilience of forested wetlands and marshes to drought, storms, and increased salinity and help forecast the loss of coastal wetlands. The project will use remote sensing, tree ring analyses, field surveys and experiments, and new statistical methods to examine the effects of droughts, storms, and increasing salinity on forested wetlands and marshes. The proposed research will: (1) Determine the spatial extent, time frame, and biogeochemical consequences of forested wetland retreat using a combination of remote sensing and tree ring and sediment cores. (2) Measure the recovery trajectory of ecosystem processes to disturbances in coastal wetlands in different ecosystem states and with varying degrees of management. (3) Test the resilience of ecosystem processes to disturbance in coastal wetlands by conducting a 5-year field experiment.","01/10/2017","04/12/2017","1713502","Marcelo","Ardon-Sayao","mlardons@ncsu.edu","01/10/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7218","RET SUPPLEMENTS","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pollington","The 31st Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics (AFW) will take place March 6-9, 2017 at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee. The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years - have two professional development panels on topics such as good mathematical writing, early career development, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. Furthermore, for the first time at AFW, there will be a ""speed"" session in which participants (primarily junior mathematicians) present short talks about current research projects which may still be in preliminary stages. <br/><br/>Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas. One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions. Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent),the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture (for which Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Bianchi, elliptic, Jacobi, Hilbert, and Siegel modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.<br/><br/>Website:http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/","01/10/2017","01/10/2017","1701585","Ralf","Schmidt","rschmidt@math.ou.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","East Tennessee State University","Johnson City","376141707","4234396000","P O Box 70565","United States","Tennessee","TN","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rodney","Keaton","keatonr@etsu.edu","01/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Olav","Richter","richter@unt.edu","01/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By the end of this century, lower-lying parts of the outer edge of the Southern U.S. coastal plain will be largely inundated by saltwater due to gradual sea level rise. The salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands may lead to significant reductions in crop and timber yields in managed ecosystems, significant declines in ecosystem carbon sequestration in unmanaged ecosystems, and degradation of coastal water quality due to extraction of soil nutrients by seasalts. This project will enhance understanding of the coupled human and natural processes influencing salinization of surface waters and adjacent lands. Investigators will build and engage a coalition of expert stakeholders, including members of state and local governments, regional planning groups, landowners and advocacy organizations. Partnerships with stakeholders will help investigators define the current status of coastal ecosystems, identify critical knowledge gaps, share new research findings, and develop and explore future land use and climate scenarios. This project will yield outcomes with predictive value in coastal systems that are easily understood by stakeholders while representing complex interactions between climate, hydrology, land use, and ecological processes and identify pathways by which outcomes could be used to enhance coastal sustainability. Together, these activities will help guide sustainable management of this region and similarly affected regions over the next several decades to centuries. Additional broader impacts include training four Ph.D. students in interdisciplinary research that spans natural and social sciences, engaging undergraduate students in mentored research experiences, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences by supporting early career investigators and working to recruit students from underrepresented groups. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.<br/><br/>This project focuses on saltwater intrusion, the landward movement of salinity from the coast onto the coastal plain. A team of investigators representing four disciplines (hydrology, biogeochemistry, community ecology, regional planning) will integrate social, hydrological, climate and ecological data into model scenarios to examine not only how human decisions affect ecosystems but also how information about those ecological impacts in turn affect human decisions. This project will facilitate development, validation and refinement of a saltwater intrusion vulnerability index (SIVI) for the Albemarle-Pamlico peninsula of North Carolina that accounts for physical environmental processes influencing the movement of water and solutes across the landscape as well as the extensive networks of canals, ditches, roads and pump stations that fundamentally alter the flow of water across the region. The index will be used, along with extensive and repeated ground-based surveys of surface water, soil and vegetation conditions across a range of vulnerable landscapes within the region, to better understand ecological impacts of saltwater intrusion. Through workshops and surveys for landowners, managers and other stakeholders in the region, the project will reveal the likely impact of land-use decisions on saltwater intrusion under scenarios of climate change.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1713435","Marcelo","Ardon-Sayao","mlardons@ncsu.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7978","Global Systems Science","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8088",NA,NA,NA,"SEES Coastal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These research areas have applications to cryptography and to mathematical physics (string theory and gauge theory). One goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in these two areas so that they will constructively interact. A second goal is to encourage young researchers to participate in these developments. A significant portion of NSF funding will be used to fund the travel and housing of junior participants (e.g. graduate students and postdocs). <br/><br/>The study of local zeta functions has undergone a dramatic revolution thanks to the introduction of motivic local zeta functions in the mid-1990s. This has led to many important developments that will be discussed at the conference, including (among others) bounds for heights of rational points on algebraic varieties, connections with model theory, and connections with the Langlands program. The above is closely entwined with the emerging study of motives associated to low genus curves and their Jacobians, and relations with Siegel modular forms. The conference will also explore connections with birational geometry of moduli of abelian varieties of low dimension.

This conference, was held at Stanford University on October 5-7, 2016 with the objective of linking together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to discuss recent advancements in microbial electrochemistry and technologies. This technology is one of many that is being investigated related to the food-energy-water nexus.<br/><br/>The topics that were covered at the North American-International Society for Microbial Electrochemistry and Technology conference was to integrate both fundamental and applied research, and cover topics were in the area of fundamental research: 1. Novel microbial pathways in microbial electrochemistry, 2. Fundamentals of extracellular electron transfer, 3. Synthetic biology approaches to optimize microbial electrochemical systems, and, 4. Microbial ecology of mixed culture systems. In the area of applied research the topics were: 1. Wastewater treatment and other bioremediation/bioenergy/biosensing applications, 2. Materials: electrodes and membranes for microbial electrochemistry and technologies, 3. Design towards applications and scale-up, and, 4. Modeling and optimization. The ISMET promotes the International and Continental meetings occurring every other year on alternating years. However, ISMET does not organize these meetings; the annual meetings are organized at the host level. The interaction among researchers from different fields created a unique environment to foster ideas and future collaborations. At the same time, these ideas could lead to novel technologies that can impact the future infrastructure at the water-energy nexus. The conference also had workshops to educate new researchers in techniques such as molecular biology and mathematical modeling. Through these workshops, the PI expected to train students that will become leaders in our field. The conference also serves to be a springboard for forging the thought processes of researchers from various backgrounds across the globe to enable the success of microbial electrochemical technologies.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1712411","Alfred","Spormann","spormann@stanford.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","1440","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Anderson","Persistent cold-air pools are a phenomena where air is effectively trapped in a basin or valley during high pressure events in wintertime. They are especially prevalent in high altitude basins in the western United States. One of the impacts of cold air pools is that particulate pollutants accumulate and affect the air quality for places like Salt Lake City, Utah. This award provides funding for researchers to take surface-based meteorological measurements during an existing aircraft-based air quality field campaign to better detail the processes that affect air movement within the cold air pools and impact the relevant chemical processes. In Salt Lake City alone there are over 1 million people affected by these events, and the research results may extend to other locations with similar topography such as Los Angeles and the Front Range of Colorado.<br/><br/>The researchers will join the NOAA-led Utah Wintertime Fine Particulate Study which will take place in Jan-Feb 2017 in the Salt Lake City region. The NSF-funded researchers will augment the air quality focused study with meteorological measurements of the persistent cold pools that set up in the valleys and basins of Utah in the wintertime. In cold air pooling events vertical mixing is inhibited and particulate pollutants accumulate and affect human health. Multiple ceilometers, a lidar, sodar, temperature sensors, a surface flux station, and radiosonde launches will be deployed as ground-based assets to complement the NOAA aircraft campaign. The deployment will target key processes and questions regarding atmospheric mixing and airmass exchange that affect chemical composition and chemical pathways of particulate air pollution formation. The specific processes include: 1) vertical mixing within the persistent cold-air pool, 2) nighttime injections of clean, but oxidant-rich air along the basin sidewalls and through down-canyon flows, 3) daytime ventilation processes along the basin sidewalls, and 4) airmass exhanges with the lake boundary layer of the Great Salt Lake.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1723337","Sebastian","Hoch","sebastian.hoch@utah.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Utah","SALT LAKE CITY","841128930","8015816903","75 S 2000 E","United States","Utah","UT","1525","PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Erik","Crosman","erik.crosman@utah.edu","01/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The key task of liposomes (storage and delivery to targets) requires them to be flexible enough to merge with target membranes in order to deliver their cargos, and yet to have sufficient structural stability to maintain integrity without rupturing and losing the stored material in the naturally dynamic biological environments. Therefore, understanding the mechanics of liposomes is of great interest to both fundamental and applied scientists who are developing artificial, biomimetic liposomes as targeted drug/gene delivery systems for better therapeutics. A major challenge however, is the lack of efficient engineering tools to probe the mechanical flexibility of the sub-cellular, nanoscale liposomes. The research addresses this need by developing a novel method based on nanopore technology that uses electric fields to deform liposomes and electrical measurements to characterize their shape. The overall goal is to characterize the mechanical flexibility of nano-liposomes with the ultimate goal to establish a method to study mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as viruses and other biological samples at cellular/molecular level.<br/><br/>This project will advance the engineering tools for mechanical characterization of soft biological materials at the micro/nanoscale. The technology uses nanopore resistive pulse sensing to detect membrane deformation. As liposomes translocate through a nanopore, they experience strong electric stresses and physical confinement, which cause deformation. In this project, liposome shapes will be inferred from ionic current blockade, i.e., the sharp change (pulse) in ohmic resistance when a liposome is present in the pore. A theoretical model for liposome deformation in the nanopore will be developed to yield membrane mechanical properties. The method will enable both high-throughput and single-particle resolution because (1) thousands of liposomes pass through the nanopore and a resistive pulse will be recorded for each individual one, and (2) thousands of measurements on a single liposome can be made by alternating the applied electric field direction to drive back-and-forth translocation. In broader terms, this method will enable studying mechanobiology at novel unprecedented scales, which is single-virus and single-particle level.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1712069","MinJun","Kim","mjkim@lyle.smu.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Southern Methodist University","Dallas","752750302","2147682030","6425 BOAZ","United States","Texas","TX","7479","Biomechanics & Mechanobiology","024E","MATERIALS DESIGN","028E","BIOMECHANICS","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stark","Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS 1612020, Principal Investigator: Agnes Beaudry<br/><br/>The project supported by this grant is part of a large scale effort to understand the homotopy groups of spheres, one of the fundamental problems in algebraic topology. The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres, which are used to study the connections between these basic components, are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. Many problems in other fields, especially differential topology, have been reduced to the study of these groups, which is notoriously difficult. However, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory. This project studies two of the most important structural conjectures in this field, the telescope and chromatic splitting conjectures. It has a strong computational component that will provide data to help study these two fundamental problems.<br/><br/>Chromatic homotopy theory uses higher analogues of K-theory which give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The chromatic splitting conjecture is an attempt at explaining the relationship between different periodicities. Recently, the PI has disproved a special case of this conjecture. In a project with Goerss and Henn, the PI aims to explain this failure and reformulate the conjecture. In a related project with Xu, the PI plans to compute the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere at the prime two. These computations use self-dual resolutions which appear to be related to Brown-Commenetz duality and the structure of the K(2)-local Picard group. The PI plans to study this connection with Bobkova, Goerss and Henn. A parallel part of the project is to study periodicity in relation to the telescope conjecture. In work with Behrens, Bhattacharya, Culver and Xu, the PI plans to detect periodic elements using a resolution of the sphere by topological modular forms. The telescope conjecture gives a connection between periodic elements detected by such methods and those detected by the K(2)-local sphere. Comparing the two computations may shed light on this conjecture.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1725563","Agnes","Beaudry","agnes.beaudry@colorado.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","1267","TOPOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is yet insufficient capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of these particles under environmental conditions. Consequently, the theory to support optimized design of the above environmental systems is lacking. Mathematical models currently can describe but not predict these behaviors because, as yet, the models do not represent the underlying mechanisms and processes for particle attachment to surfaces under environmental conditions. The proposed research aims to determine whether observed complex colloid transport behaviors will emerge from pore-scale representation of the surface heterogeneity responsible for particle attachment. The proposed investigations involve parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and network (packed sand column) scales. The research will provide for a transformative platform for researchers and practitioners to perform mechanistic prediction of particle transport for design of solutions to environmental problems. Additional broader impacts include engagement of middle and high school biology, chemistry, and earth science teachers in six-week long summer internships where they undertake field and laboratory experiences examining the role of particles in trace element transport and transformation.<br/><br/>The capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of colloids under environmental conditions (e.g., non log-linear profiles of retained colloids, extended tailing of low concentrations, blocking, and ripening) is currently lacking. Empirically based continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors are employed in the advection-dispersion equation to describe, and to a limited extent predict, the observed complex transport behaviors. Whereas these descriptions are extremely useful indicators of mechanisms, true predictive capability will be possible only if the underlying physicochemical mechanisms/processes are identified and parameterized at a more fundamental level. Pore scale (nanoscale) colloid-surface interactions are well-demonstrated to exert profound influences on colloid transport behaviors at the continuum scale (column and field). This research aims to determine whether the continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors can be predicted, and the whether the observed complex continuum-scale behavior will emerge, from pore-scale representation of surface heterogeneity and network-scale representation of packing structure. This investigation involves parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and continuum (column) scales. Coupled pore scale force/torque balance simulations will be conducted to pore/grain network simulations in order to develop mechanistic prediction of continuum scale rate constants and scaling factors. New approaches will be used to represent surface heterogeneity responsible for colloid attachment to bulk repulsive surfaces at the pore scale. The proposed research will also capitalize on, and extend, recent understanding of influences of topology at the continuum (network) scale where the transition between molecular (diffusion-driven) and particle (trajectory-driven) transport behaviors will be explored.","01/11/2017","01/11/2017","1721660","Markus","Hilpert","mh3632@columbia.edu","01/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Columbia University","NEW YORK","100276902","2128546851","2960 Broadway","United States","New York","NY","1579","HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the displaced are located in states adjacent to their countries of origin, primarily in the Middle East or Africa. One of the characteristics of contemporary displacement is that these countries of first asylum host the majority of refugees, who often live in limbo in camps or urban centers for years, while richer states keep refugees and migrants at arms' length through policies of deterrence and border control. However, from 2014 through 2016 more than one million migrants reached Europe via the Balkan land route, breaching ""Fortress Europe"" in unprecedented fashion. This mass migration has far reaching impacts for the stability of the European Union and the lives of millions of refugees and migrants. Yet, almost no empirical research has been conducted on the route, leaving open questions about how the route was forged and the role of refugees themselves in its creation. These questions can only be answered through ethnographic fieldwork while many of the key actors and sites remain in place along the route. This research takes place in the context of the largest global forced migration since World War II. Findings will be disseminated to aid organizations that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of mass migration. The research also fosters international scientific cooperation, and will train undergraduate students in methods of anthropological data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>This RAPID award supports fieldwork in Egypt, Greece, Serbia, and Germany - countries of departure, transit, and destination - to understand mobility along the Balkan route. The investigators, Drs. Nadia El-Shaarawi and Maple Razsa of Colby College, have longstanding relationships with migrants and refugees from the Middle East, as well as networks along the route, which will allow them to gain access to sites that might otherwise be clandestine and inaccessible. Through participant observation and interviews at sites that have been crucial to recent migrant mobility, sites where migrants and humanitarian workers come together, the researchers will study the forms of negotiation and struggle that made the route possible. Further, they will investigate how migrants experience and manage efforts to restrict their movement. A focus on the route itself, and the ways that refugees and migrants sustained mobility within networks along the route, will provide an empirical alternative to analyses of refugees as victims as well as a methodological tendency to study refugees in place. Such an approach will shed light on how migrant mobility itself is organized, sustained, and curtailed. While the ongoing crisis is unique in scale, an understanding of its social complexity can inform our knowledge of other, similar processes of migration and displacement in the U.S. and worldwide. With the number of refugees only increasing globally, displacement remains a topic of important social and political concern.","01/12/2017","01/12/2017","1719421","Nadia","El-Shaarawi","nrelshaa@colby.edu","01/12/2017","Principal Investigator","Colby College","Waterville","049018840","2078594770","4000 Mayflower Hill","United States","Maine","ME","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Maple","Razsa","maple.razsa@colby.edu","01/12/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Insufficient iron has been shown to limit phytoplankton growth in large regions of the surface ocean, and correspondingly, iron cycling is directly linked to carbon cycling in much of the marine environment. Nearly all iron in seawater (>99%) exists as complexes with organic molecules called ligands, which govern the concentration of iron dissolved in the water and the bioavailability of that iron to phytoplankton. However, despite the importance of iron-binding organic ligands, their sources and identities are largely unknown. Viruses, the majority of which are phages (viruses that infect bacteria), are extremely abundant in seawater and are in the same size fraction as dissolved iron. Recent evidence that non-marine phages contain iron as part of their structures has led to the proposal that marine phages may represent a previously overlooked class of organic iron-binding ligands. This project is determining the contribution of marine phages to dissolved iron pools and culture phage-host systems in the laboratory to determine if phages utilize bacterial iron-uptake receptors for infection in the manner of a Trojan horse. As the first study to examine the biogeochemical impact of trace elements contained within the structure of highly abundant marine phage particles, successful completion of the proposed research will be transformative for biological and chemical oceanography and have far-reaching implications for other fields, including human health where iron availability plays an important role in microbial pathogenesis. This project contributes to the multidisciplinary training of a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher. Research results will be disseminated through scientific publications and presentations, and the public will be educated about linkages between viruses and ocean chemistry via a hands-on exhibit for the annual St. Petersburg Science Festival. <br/><br/> Building upon evidence from non-marine model systems demonstrating the presence of iron ions in phage tail proteins and phage utilization of cell surface receptors for siderophore-bound iron, this project combines field and laboratory-based experiments to test the following three hypotheses regarding iron-virus interactions in the oceans: (1) Iron incorporated into phage tails originates from bacterial cell reserves, reducing the amount of iron available for remineralization upon lysis; (2) Phages constitute important iron-binding ligands in the oceans, accounting for a substantial portion of organically complexed colloidal dissolved iron; (3) Marine phages compete with siderophore-bound iron for uptake receptors on the bacterial cell surface and use iron in their tails as a Trojan horse for infection. Initial calculations predict that phages could account for up to 70% of the colloidal fraction of organically complexed dissolved iron in the surface ocean; therefore, this project is critical for advancing knowledge of trace-metal cycling as well as phage-host interactions. Additionally, if a portion of the cellular iron thought to be released from bacterial cells for remineralization following lysis is already incorporated into phage tails, then these findings will have significant implications for oceanic biogeochemical models. Through a combination of laboratory-based culture experiments and field sample measurements, this project could reveal the identity of a ubiquitous component of colloidal organic iron-binding ligands, modify the estimates of iron concentrations and species released through viral lysis, and potentially identify a novel receptor type for marine phage that may compete with the acquisition of siderophore-bound iron by host bacteria.","01/12/2017","01/12/2017","1722761","Mya","Breitbart","mya@marine.usf.edu","01/12/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of South Florida","Tampa","336129446","8139742897","3702 Spectrum Blvd.","United States","Florida","FL","1650","BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","7916","EAGER","8811","Marine Microbial Ecology","9117","MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY","1670","CHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY",NA,NA,"Kristen","Buck","kristenbuck@usf.edu","01/12/2017","Principal Investigator","1670",NA,NA,NA,"CHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three-Dimensional mapping of the underwater world in an ecologically relevant way requires mapping not only the physical limits of a specific arena but also the biology within it. Here, the researchers propose to revolutionize the way scientists build near-scale (5-10m) underwater maps by the construction of a UV-Multispectral-Polarization imager with complete multilevel imaging features enabling 3D mapping and full optical characterization of underwater environments. The proposed 3D imager will overcome the challenge of a moving and scattering medium; overcome the problems that cripple conventional scanning devices (e.g. co-registration); while simultaneously filling in the 3D map with biologically meaningful information with images and complete characterization of the light field. With such a device, one will have the capability to map the physical footprint of the underwater world, but also extract species identification from optical characteristics, movement characteristics of organisms within it, health/condition status of biological organisms (e.g. coral reefs, oil spills, plastic contaminants), and comprehensive optical characterization. In addition to providing fine scale mapping of underwater worlds that will serve both biological and conservation missions, the researchers will also use this technology to engage STEM programs in both the Austin and St. Louis areas.<br/><br/>This is a Collaborative OTIC award to develop a state-of-the-art 3D imaging device whose purpose is to transform the way researchers map underwater environments and biologically characterize the features within it. The principle investigators propose to develop a high spatial and temporal resolution multispectral polarimeter capable of measuring polarization information in RGB bandwidths combined with three separate and distinct narrow spectral bandwidth channels, one of which being in the UV spectrum. This will produce 12 distinct optical channels that are inherently co-registered, with polarization detection allowing for dehazing capabilities to greatly increase the effectiveness of visual simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms (VSLAM) for obtaining 3D map reconstruction. The co-registered channels will overlay maps with optical information for identifying and measuring benthic characteristics. This next generation underwater mapping device will provide scientists with simultaneous information on (i) physical dimensional space (3D depth), (ii) surface characteristics that identify benthos and organisms within the environment (imaging), (iii) optical characterization of the water column and benthos, as well as (iv) allow for fine-scale tracking of organisms within these underwater environments. This device will enable broad ranges of research questions from oceanographers and marine scientists interested in monitoring coral reefs, animal behaviorists studying 3D camouflage and communication properties, to conservation scientists interested in monitoring environmental degradation (oil and plastic contaminants). This collaborative effort will (a) produce a polarization imaging sensor that captures multispectral polarization information in real-time (~20fps), with low power dissipation and with high spatial resolution, (b) provide dynamic multispectral information on underwater features that were previously unattainable due to scanning technologies with low temporal resolution (~1min), (c) develop software to map and track underwater environments modifying currently developed open source VSLAM software, and (d) test emerging biological hypotheses on camouflage, communication and coral reef monitoring.","01/12/2017","01/12/2017","1724615","Viktor","Gruev","vgruev@wustl.edu","01/12/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1680","OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tap water from a central water treatment facility or a local well is generally of high enough quality to drink without further treatment; however, there are geographic areas where the water is either permanently or temporarily unsafe. Other needs include addressing water aesthetics that are not at unsafe levels but are not desired by the consumer. To enter this market a product needs to be differentiated and cost sensitive. In this project the team we will focus on evaluating the competitive landscape, identifying commercialization partners, and understanding the consumer needs in industrial and household application.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project uses a new method to cast bio-inspired water treatment membranes. Aquaporin, a highly selective water channel protein, has received worldwide attention because of its potential to form aquaporin-based membranes with high flux and rejection for water treatment. The high water permeability and selectivity of aquaporins makes aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes attractive for water purification. In this project pores or channels specifically engineered in a pore-spanning biomimetic membrane to maximize water transport efficiency, compared to conventional polymer membrane filters. These bio-inspired membranes display higher contaminant rejection efficiency and significantly improved backflush cleaning effectiveness as compared to traditional membranes.

It is proposed to utilize flue-gas borne CO2 as an 'ingredient' to rapidly mineralize digitally fabricated construction components. The reinvented cementation chemistry and process enable producing high-quality building elements faster than it is possible today. It also enables the integration of a confluence of technologies, mating carbonate-based cementation solutions with digital fabrication technologies to overcome challenges facing the construction sector today, including its large CO2 footprint, while also potentially improving productivity. By rationalizing workflows, enhancing automation, and originating new materials, this project develops innovative pathways to disruptively transform the construction sector.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project exploits new advances made the rapid ambient temperature mineralization of carbonate solids. The central technology is based on approaches for sequestering CO2 borne in flue gases in light metal carbonates. This renders carbonate-based cementation agents, which offer performance that is equivalent or superior to traditional cement and concrete. Recent studies have revealed that carbonation hardening process is rapid. Under suitable conditions it proceeds to completion in 24 hours or less, substantially faster than existing cementation solutions. Due to their simple composition and chemical homogeneity, the carbonate cement precursors offer flexible, and well-controllable rheology, an important prerequisite for enabling digital fabrication using these materials. Taken together, carbonate-cements offer new routes towards CO2-neutral cementation, and construction.","01/13/2017","01/13/2017","1719227","Bu","Wang","wangbu@ucla.edu","01/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gaurav","Sant","gsant@ucla.edu","01/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current workflows require extensive manual repair of geometric models before they can be used for Computer-Aided Engineering/Manufacturing. Within the US automotive industry alone nearly $600M/year is spent in direct cost and lost productivity on mitigating CAD problems. Entire business units or job shops are employed to deal with this expensive problem by repairing or reworking gap-ridden geometric models. Commercializing the algorithm developed will result in improved productivity in the engineering design process, resulting in better products that are designed more quickly than is possible with current CAD technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on development and commercialization of a novel software algorithm that resolves a ubiquitous problem in the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) industry, the gaps that arise at the intersections of surfaces in CAD models. The majority of modern geometric modeling relies on parametric freeform surfaces built as complex combinations of much simpler geometric shapes. However, the intersection of freeform surfaces in CAD currently results in highly approximated, incomplete solutions. The approach developed here is based on a thorough understanding of the parametric space underlying the geometry of most modern CAD models. The algorithm classifies and segments the intersection curve in parametric space, then reconstructs the intersecting surfaces such that their boundaries are guaranteed to lie on the intersection curve to the tolerance set by the user of the CAD system. The approach solves the problem in a way that produces objects in the same form as that of the original models, making them available in the modeler's native software package.","01/13/2017","01/13/2017","1707226","Richard","Crawford","rhc@mail.utexas.edu","01/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fragaszy","The devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 on the northeast United States highlighted the need to improve the ability of coastal communities to quickly respond and rebound from natural hazards. There is a trend towards implementing ""soft"" engineering solutions such as dunes reinforced with Geotextile Sand Containers (GSC) to improve resiliency rather than traditional hardened structures like stone revetments. These have the potential to protect communities from smaller storm events (e.g. 25-year storms) while at the same time providing flexibility in design considering the uncertainty regarding rates of sea level rise and storm frequency. ""Soft"" engineering solutions may also be less disruptive to the natural morphology of barrier beach systems than hardened structures. However, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the mechanisms that affect the stability of reinforced dunes under wave attack. The objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect perishable data to assess the stability and performance of a 1000 m section of a dune reinforced with GSCs in Montauk, NY that was impacted by Tropical Storm Hermine in September 2016. The reinforced dune was constructed in March 2016, and Tropical Storm Hermine resulted in complete erosion of the protective berm, exposure of the GSC core, and movement of the lower level of GSCs. <br/><br/>A detailed 3-D digital elevation model of both the eroded beach (topography) as well as the near-shore bathymetry will be constructed. This will be accomplished through two surveys: an aerial LIDAR survey using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and a combined ship-mounted LIDAR and interferometric sonar system. These data will provide a detailed case study of the effects of wave action on a dune reinforced with GSCs. This will allow for the application of findings from numerical and wave flume studies to an actual field case at a scale not reproducible in the laboratory. It is hypothesized that current stability equations are unconservative in that they underpredict the hydraulic stability of geotextile containers associated with reduced scale experiments. Analysis of this case study will also improve our understanding of whether reinforced dunes perform as ""soft"" coastal structures and do not significantly modify the natural morphology of the shoreline.","01/13/2017","01/13/2017","1719671","John","King","jwking@uri.edu","01/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Rhode Island","KINGSTON","028811967","4018742635","RESEARCH OFFICE","United States","Rhode Island","RI","014Y","Engineering for Natural Hazard","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","037E","GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING","041E","HAZARD AND DISASTER REDUCTION","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","Christopher","Baxter","cbaxter@uri.edu","01/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaron","Bradshaw","abrads@uri.edu","01/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Stephen","Licht","slicht@egr.uri.edu","01/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,"CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Zanzerkia","Over the past year two sinkhole events in central Florida attracted significant media attention. In March 2013, a sinkhole collapsed beneath a house in Seffner and ?swallowed? a person from his bedroom. In August 2013 a sinkhole collapse destroyed a resort complex near Disney World. These dramatic events, however, are just extreme examples that stand out from a steady stream of property damage, which spikes at times of anthropogenic groundwater withdrawals. Detecting incipient sinkhole activity, particularly that which may result in sudden collapse, is a challenging task. However, recent improvements in the detection and resolution capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites enable nowadays space-base detection of small movements of the Earth?s surface at the millimeter/year level. In this project SAR observations acquired over central Florida by German and Italian SAR satellites will be used. Interferometric processing of the data using advanced time series analysis techniques, will provide detailed maps of surface movements and will allow detection of localized subsiding areas that may be indicative of sinkhole activity. Verification of the space-base sinkhole detection will be conducted using Ground Penetrating Radar surveys. Successful detection of pre-collapse sinkhole activities will serve as very important tool to minimize life and property hazard in central Florida and other sinkhole-prone areas worldwide.<br/><br/>Sinkhole activity in central Florida is a major natural hazard, resulting in severe property damage and occasionally in life loss. The Inferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) will be used to monitor sinkhole activities in central Florida, in order to detect subsiding sites and resolve possible precursory subsidence prior to sinkhole collapse. The German satellite TerraSAR-X and the Italian satellite constellation Cosmo-SkyMed will be tasked to acquire high-resolution observations (sub-meter pixel resolution) over selected areas, with repeat acquisition intervals of 10-20 days. Interferometric processing of the data using InSAR time series techniques will provide high spatial resolution maps of surface movements with 1-2 mm/yr accuracy, which will enable detection of localized subsidence and better understand activity that may be precursory to sinkhole collapse. The space-based data will be used to select sites for study with sub-meter scale ground-penetrating radar surveys. The purpose of this limited scale project is to provide a proof-of-concept that InSAR observations can be used to detect precursory sinkhole activity in the challenging sub-tropical vegetation-rich environment of central Florida. Successful space-based detection of sinkhole activity will lead to further utilization of InSAR observations for sinkhole hazard mitigation in central Florida and other sinkhole-prone areas worldwide.","01/13/2017","01/13/2017","1713420","Shimon","Wdowinski","shimonw2@gmail.com","01/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Florida International University","Miami","331990001","3053482494","11200 SW 8TH ST","United States","Florida","FL","1574","GEOPHYSICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7458","1580",NA,NA,"GEOMORPHOLOGY & LAND USE DYNAM","INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also promotes the growth of algae in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, which interferes with tourism, recreation as well as other commercial uses of these areas. The two principal sources of nitrate entering water supplies are the runoff of nitrate fertilizers from agricultural fields and the discharge from municipal and industrial waste-water treatment plants. Intercepting these waters and eliminating the nitrate from them before it enters the environment constitutes a major segment of the potential for commercialization of the technology. Drinking water treatment plants are a potential commercial user, as are homeowners with water purification systems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the potential commercialization of a filter to eliminate nitrate from water. It consists of a bed of sand grains coated with an iron-bearing clay mineral. Before coating, the clay is engineered to react with nitrate. Once coated, the sand/clay mineral attracts and reacts with nitrate in the flowing water, changing it to harmless nitrogen gas or ammonium. Iron in the clay is the key for changing the nitrate. The intellectual merit of the project is that three independent research findings were combined to make the filter. These include processes to reverse the charge on the clay surfaces, changing the iron charge to react with nitrate, and finally engineering a system with suitable flow characteristics.","01/14/2017","01/14/2017","1722502","Joseph","Stucki","jstucki@illinois.edu","01/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Astaxanthin is an especially economically important pigment used in the aquaculture, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. Astaxanthin can be made synthetically but there is increasing demand for naturally sourced astaxanthin. Currently, the market value of natural astaxanthin for aquaculture feed is approximately $2000/kg and the nutraceutical market value for natural astaxanthin is alomst $15,000/kg. Recent estimates of the global astaxanthin market size are at more than 250 tons in 2014 and a projected compound annual growth rate of over 7% from 2016 to 2023. This technology provides two main benefits to customers: a natural source of astaxanthin at a potentially lower cost than current sources and potential for future engineering to further increase astaxanthin production and reduce production costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of genetically engineered lineages of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus that produced up to 80% more natural astaxanthin than wild copepods. Copepods are tiny crustaceans related to shrimp and are natural component of marine fish diets. This technology is an improvement over the current sources because copepods potentially produce more red pigment at a lower production cost, and it has been demonstrated that genetic engineering for increased astaxanthin production is feasible. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities for the technology through customer discovery interviews that will result in customer feedback that provides a better understanding of the requirements for commercialization. Additionally, this project has the potential to lead to significant progress in research on natural pigment production for commercial applications.","01/14/2017","01/14/2017","1722484","Geoffrey","Hill","ghill@acesag.auburn.edu","01/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Auburn University","Auburn University","368490001","3348444438","310 Samford Hall","United States","Alabama","AL","8023","I-Corps","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ryan","Weaver","rjw0019@auburn.edu","01/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

UV sensors have wide ranging markets from industrial, manufacturing, health, to consumer applications, and therefore have significant potential for societal and economic impact. The general public will benefit from the significant reduction in the capital and recurring cost of UV sensor technologies brought by the innovation. The technology has the potential to impact the UV sensor industry by providing lower power consumption, wider operation temperature ranges, and the potential for flexible device embodiments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will enable customer discovery for a core technology that could potentially impact the ultraviolet (UV) sensor industry. Due to large surface-to-volume ratio and reduced dimensionality of the active area, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have been shown to have high photon conductance, which leads to high sensitivity of the device performance. Utilizing the Schottky contact instead of conventional Ohmic contact in device fabrication, the sensitivity and response time of ZnO UV nanosensors have been greatly improved. In addition, the device can be deposited on silicon as well as flexible substrates. The characteristics of the ZnO UV nanosensor (i.e. performance metrics, system integration, packaging, form factors, etc.) will be aligned with current and future customer needs, while at the same time, a business model will be explored for this novel technology.","01/14/2017","01/14/2017","1724493","Zhong","Wang","zhong.wang@mse.gatech.edu","01/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When combined with adult stem/stromal cell (ASC) therapies these techniques may result in a new regenerative medicine paradigm. Several miRNA and other potential oligonucleotide based therapeutics have been demonstrated to posses potent bioactivity but current state-of-the-art oligonucleotide delivery techniques are largely incompatible with clinical therapies due to toxicity and lack of specific action. This project will address the critical need for a clinically relevant, safe and effective miRNA delivery system which provides temporal and spatial control of activation at the site of diseased or damaged tissue. As a primary objective the project will optimize, a nanoparticle (NP) based, light activated, miRNA delivery system (LAMD) for the light activated spatial and temporal regulation of bone and blood vessel formation using ASC as a model system. A secondary objective is the development of a more cost effective and robust processes for the fabrication of a targeted version of the basic LAMD system. Research into manufacturing processes with improved yields and morphological control will address a critical limitation to the development of therapies using targeted particles.<br/><br/>With the lengthening life span and increasing activity levels of the aging population we expect to see a substantial increase in the number of patients presenting with orthopaedic injuries. Of particular interest are solutions to skeletal disorders, such as bone disunions and non-healing, critical sized defects caused by wear, cancers, trauma or as the result joint replacement. The development of a photoactivated, nanoparticle based, miRNA delivery system that addresses the limitations of traditional miRNA delivery vectors while providing for spatial and temporal control of activity could be transformative for miRNA use in regenerative medicine. This project will provide direct support for several undergraduate and graduate students per year to work on this project as research scholars. The project presents a unique and interdisciplinary opportunity for students majoring in biomedical engineering, chemistry and related fields to build fundamental knowledge and appreciation in the areas of nanomaterial synthesis, stem cell biology, photobiology and regenerative medicine.

This technology hypothetically enables the targeting of pest species with only a very specific genetic sequence using silencing of genes required for their survival, thereby potentially eliminating environmental health and safety concerns associated with chemical pesticides. dsRNA has poor stability in the environment and is not readily absorbed by many pest species. Using nanoparticles to deliver dsRNA can help overcome problems with stability and facilitate absorption by pests. However, limited information on the persistence and long-term fate of these materials in soil is available and there are little established techniques for detecting and characterizing these materials in the environment. This project will develop techniques to track these materials in soil and characterize their degradation. The tools developed and insights gained by this project will enable the development of more benign nanocomposite pesticides. This will aid in increasing global food security while helping to avoid unwanted environmental impacts resulting from pesticide application. <br/><br/>The objective of this project will be to establish a set of methods to track the fate and transformations of dsRNA nanocomposites in soil and in soil organisms, to do preliminary testing of their stability in soil solutions, and to assess possible bio-uptake non-target effects in soil organisms. It will focus on biopolymer polyplex dsRNA nanocomposites and inorganic (calcium phosphate) core with a biopolymer/dsRNA coating. The main hypothesis that will be tested is that binding of dsRNA to a nanocomposite makes it more persistent in soil and in non-target organisms, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects. The PI will synthesize diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE), chitosan, poly-L-lysine and poly-L-histidine coated calcium phosphate particles loaded with dsRNA complimentary to the green fluorescent protein gene. This gene is present within a genetically modified strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (PD4251) which the PI will use as a model organism. Because the gene is only expressed within cells in the body wall, silencing of this gene ensures that the dsRNA has been taken up and internalized within the worm. Nanocomposites will then be aged in soil solutions of varying composition for varying lengths of time to determine how transformations in soil affect their bioactivity. The PI will track the fate of the nanoparticles in soil solution and in organisms by isotopically labeling calcium phosphate with the stable 44Ca isotope and fluorescently labelling the dsRNA. The florescence label will be tracked using asymmetrical field flow fractionation (AF4) coupled to fluorescence spectroscopy. The isotopically labelled core will be detected using AF4 coupled to ICP-MS. Bio-uptake of the materials will be assessed using laser confocal microscopy. The PI will systematically characterize how soil chemistry and aging time affect aggregation, disassembly, dsRNA degradation, bio-uptake, specific bioactivity and non-target effects.","01/17/2017","01/17/2017","1712323","Olga","Tsyusko","olga.tsyusko@uky.edu","01/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Kentucky Research Foundation","Lexington","405260001","8592579420","109 Kinkead Hall","United States","Kentucky","KY","1179","Biol & Envir Inter of Nano Mat","7916","EAGER","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jason","Unrine","jason.unrine@uky.edu","01/17/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This drought has resulted in large declines in forage for many grazing species, which have experienced significant population declines as a result. The remaining animals have been left to consume low quality, mostly unpalatable, forage. How these changes may alter future plant communities is not known. For almost a decade, scientists have been studying the impact of fire frequency and large grazers on ecosystem processes in savanna grassland in KNP under what used to be considered normal climatic conditions. With the onset of extreme drought, they now have an opportunity to study how the effects of fire and grazing may change as climatic conditions change, and what this might mean for plant productivity and populations of large grazer species. Climate models predict an intensification of climate extremes globally, a phenomenon that is already evident in weather patterns today, so there is a great need to develop a better understanding of how these rare climatic events may be reshaping ecosystems. In addition to enhancing understanding of savanna grasslands and testing fundamental ecological theory, this research will provide crucial information on the impact of climate extremes on plants and their grazers, which will be of great value to decision makers that manage national parks. <br/><br/>The proposed research will document the effects of a historically exceptional drought on a savanna grassland (characterized by a mixture of both woody and herbaceous plants) in KNP in the context of an existing long-term grazing and fire experiment. Documenting the potentially transformational nature of rare climatic events is in itself an opportunity seldom afforded ecologists, but to have pre-treatment data and a long-term, well-replicated experiment in place that manipulates the key disturbances most likely to interact with extreme drought is unprecedented. Because forecasts are for this exceptional drought to conclude in early 2017, this RAPID project focuses on gathering data at the end of this exceptional climate event to assess the potential for drought, fire and grazing to trigger a shift in the plant community that will result in an increase in the relative abundance of palatable grasses. This research has implications for not only understanding the determinants of grassland biodiversity, but also for increasing our knowledge of how rare climate extremes may transform ecosystems. Currently, KNP managers are grappling with a long-term trend of grassland degradation which has led to the loss of palatable forage for wildlife. The current exceptional drought, while exacerbating this problem in the short-term, may increase forage quality across much of KNPs grasslands. In addition, this project will establish close collaborative ties between US researchers and scientists in South Africa. The lead scientists on this project will continue to work closely with KNP scientists to ensure that all results are communicated in a way to inform management decisions in KNP. Dissemination of all datasets and results will be achieved via a dedicated webpage, housed at Colorado State University.","01/17/2017","01/17/2017","1712786","Scott","Collins","scollins@sevilleta.unm.edu","01/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Colorado State University","Fort Collins","805232002","9704916355","601 S Howes St","United States","Colorado","CO","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Melinda","Smith","melinda.smith@colostate.edu","01/17/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alan","Knapp","Alan.Knapp@ColoState.EDU","01/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Deron","Burkepile","deron.burkepile@lifesci.ucsb.edu","01/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sally","Koerner","sally.koerner@colostate.edu","01/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. This collaborative project will add to fundamental research in the core area of broadening participation for all women in engineering. It will address the lack of a well-defined body of research methods, studies, and data on the intersection of race, gender, and class among all women. The project will focus on populations that include African American, Hispanic/Latina, Asian/Asian-American, Native American, White, and multiracial women in tenured faculty positions at higher education institutions within the United States. To do this work, collaborative teams of engineering educators, engineers, and social scientists at Purdue University and Vanderbilt University will study challenges and barriers women encounter in engineering. The study will be guided by an intersectional framework that seeks to uncover why engineering faculty from these groups persist despite the challenges that face them based on race, gender, and class.<br/><br/>The proposed study is framed within the institutional (systemic relationships of domination and subordination); symbolic (stereotypical or controlling images); and individual (institutional and symbolic) dimensions of oppression according to Hills Collins' intersectional framework. The project will use mixed methods to identify longitudinal trends in engineering for all women and investigate perspectives about persistence and resilience among the targeted populations. The research will involve descriptive and trend analyses of data collected from 350 institutions by the American Society for Engineering Education, followed a national survey of women selected from the same database. These steps will be augmented by data collected through institutional analyses, a small pilot study, and face-to-face interviews. Interpretation of data culled from these data sources will be triangulated to collectively document unique characteristics, experiences, and factors about oppressions faced by women who persist in engineering. If the outcomes show specific reasons why some women persist, as well as identify barriers to their persistence, the findings could serve as a launching pad for companion studies and the development of interventions. These outcomes could then inform ways to address institutional, symbolic, and individual changes that are fundamental to broadening the participation of all women in engineering.","01/17/2017","01/17/2017","1712618","Monica","Cox","cox.1192@osu.edu","01/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Ohio State University","Columbus","432101016","6146888735","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Ohio","OH","1544","RES ON GENDER IN SCI & ENGINE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary goal is to systematically investigate the effects of characteristics of contextualized items on student performance to strengthen practices in science assessments, ensure fairness in science testing, and increase support for both assessment and instructional purposes. Test items with contexts are called contextualized items which include supplemental information that precedes or follows a test item question. Such information may include a description of a lab setup, a natural phenomenon, or a practical problem often depicted as a scenario, background, vignette, or cover story. The project findings will help to understand how students make sense of contextualized items focusing on complex scientific concepts that they usually encounter in science assessments. Currently, contextualized items are constructed from either conventional wisdom or non-contextualized item writing rules. Such items could mislead students to attend to irrelevant information or interfere with the targeted construct, and, therefore lead to inaccurate inferences about student learning. This project will develop a framework for developing items to help address this problem. Approximately, 70 classroom teachers and 4800 students, in secondary grades, will participate in the study. <br/><br/>The project will offer a theoretical articulation of the characteristics of contextualized items and empirically test the effects on student performance. It seeks to address four gaps in the literature on contextualized items: (1) insufficient knowledge about how to conceptualize construct-relevant contextualized items; (2) lack of research on contextualized items in science; (3) lack of research that systematically studies the characteristics of contexts and evaluates their effects on student performance; and (4) the need for studies that examine differential effects related to subgroups of students to gain a greater clarity of what types of contexts affect whom. The research design and data analyses will be guided by three research questions: (1) what are critical context characteristics that may affect student performance and should therefore be considered when developing science test items? (2) what are context characteristics associated with construct-relevant variance? (3) what context characteristics are associated with differential student performance patterns due to gender, ELL status, and socioeconomic-status variables?<br/><br/>The project will take place over three years through a two phase process. During Phase 1 the project will refine a proposed theoretical framework that will identify the item context characteristics and articulate the item development guidelines. During Phase 2, the goal is to apply the framework by selecting, revising, and developing science items with varying profiles of contexts; conduct field tests of the items; and perform a range of psychometric and statistical procedures with test scores, and qualitative analyses of students' cognitive interview responses and teacher interviews. Items resulting from this process will aim to evoke students' stored knowledge relevant to the content and/or process skills targeted. The project will involve a team of researchers specialized in assessment development and validation, science education, content knowledge, linguists, and expert classroom teachers. The item development approach and items generated from this project will have immediate implications for researchers and practitioners in science education nationally and internationally.","01/17/2017","01/17/2017","1710657","Maria Araceli","Ruiz-Primo","aruiz@stanford.edu","01/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","7980","Core R&D Programs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Arctic grayling migrates annually between breeding sites in streams and unfrozen overwintering habitat. Their movement is restricted to a small number of interconnecting waterways. Warmer climates are creating dry streambeds when fish need to migrate to winter habitat. Warmer streams could challenge fish adapted to cooler water. Substantial movement, plasticity, or adaptive genetic variation might allow for resilience to these stressors. This study proposes to study populations from three representative Arctic streams that differ in temperature, connectivity, and sensitivity to climate change. Pilot data indicate increasing drying events that threaten the grayling?s return to overwintering sites as well as substantial population structure among and within watersheds. Species can respond to climate change through movement, phenotypic plasticity, or local adaptive evolution. Most research fails to address one or more of these fundamental strategies, and these gaps currently limit our ability to predict future responses with accuracy. This study addresses all three strategies to understand the persistence of a key Arctic species. The researchers will address five broader impact areas: 1) expanding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, including promoting opportunities for minority involvement of native Alaskans; 2) building upon existing links between Arctic research field crews and K-12 educators in the lower 48 states; 3) broadening scientific understanding in Arctic minority communities, including residents in Barrow, AK and initiating new outreach to Anaktuvuk, AK; 4) enhancing public education via governmental outreach, media relations, and publicly accessible web resources; and 5) expanding cooperation with state and federal agencies in developing management recommendations for Arctic fish.<br/><br/>This study will 1) assay movement at four time scales ranging from days to centuries; 2) evaluate plasticity and adaptive differentiation among populations; 3) assess populations for loci under selection; and 4) determine natural selection against grayling subpopulations by integrating data on selected loci with the movement of individually tagged fish. This study will test how watershed characteristics influence movement patterns using individual tagging, otolith micro-chemistry, and genomics. Individual tagging records fine-scale daily movement, otolith micro-chemistry allows the reconstruction of lifetime movement patterns, and genomic data reveals recent and historical movement across the landscape and genes under selection. Lastly, this study will quantify genetic and environmental contributions to performance of fish from divergent environments.","01/17/2017","01/17/2017","1719267","Linda","Deegan","ldeegan@mbl.edu","01/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Woods Hole Research Center","Falmouth","025401644","5084441526","149 Woods Hole Road","United States","Massachusetts","MA","5280","ARCTIC NATURAL SCIENCES","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Photonics uses light instead of electronics to perform a variety of functions such as information processing and transfer. While most of us still work in offices and meet friends in person, mobile and networking device capability has enabled massive online business and social transaction growth. The Internet and its cloud-based services are used for production systems, banking, entertainment, social interaction, information distribution and research. Resulting information accumulation is fueling the rise of ""big data,"" as well as the powerful correlation tools that help analysts spot financial trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and improve quality of research. More and more, we put content in the cloud for easy access from anywhere and at any time, with data growing exponentially. All this data transfer uses a surprising amount of energy. To reduce data center energy consumption while increasing data capacity by over ten fold, this research will investigate novel hybrid data communication interfaces, using light rather than electrons to process and transfer data at higher speeds. The potentially explosive increase in data rates enabled by these hybrid photonic interconnects could lead to several transformative applications, such as future exascale data centers, terabit speed local area networks, and massively-parallel computing for big data applications. These hybrid photonic interconnects will not only have a broad impact on the semiconductor industry, but also US energy sustainability and security, as more energy-efficient computing systems would reduce carbon footprint of the Internet cloud. Further, to prepare students for the workforce with the necessary skills to drive future technology, the project includes a strong educational component. Interactive learning methods will be employed to teach electronic circuits and to bring photonics to integrated circuit design. The project also incorporates a high school outreach program, with an annual Smart Environments for Sustainability-themed one-week summer camp for high school students that commits to fostering women and minority group representation in integrated circuit design.<br/><br/>Technology development leveraging integrated photonic circuits and optical interconnects has thus far largely focused on binary communication using silicon photonic modulators. To enable future optical interconnects for higher data rates and energy-efficiency, researchers must reconsider the hybrid integrated circuit paradigm. An important technology enabler is the high-speed signal processing capability of integrated photonic devices. The research approach will first be to develop a photonic design kit with standard cell libraries and compact models to enable large scale integration of photonic devices into hybrid integrated circuits. Researchers will employ photonic device high-speed optical domain signal processing into novel circuit configurations, exploit synergistic interaction between electronic and photonic components, and form a mixed-signal photonic architecture. Next, to exploit photonics beyond binary interconnects; researchers will develop novel mixed-signal photonic data converters, which they will use to demonstrate an advanced modulation transceiver architecture that is scalable to terabits per second data rates with order-of-magnitude lower energy consumption. Research outcomes will empower integrated circuit researchers by equipping them with a new photonics expertise to tackle nano-scaled technology design challenges, where data transfer bottlenecks constrain system performance. The photonic design kit will lower industry barriers to help facilitate photonics adoption into integrated circuits; resulting mixed-signal photonic data converter architectures will set a new paradigm by achieving greater than 10 GHz sampling rates with significantly reduced energy consumption over existing complementary metal?oxide?semiconductor (CMOS)-only architectures. Researchers will broadly disseminate project results by developing online educational material for a new CMOS photonics integrated circuit design graduate course, and through international journals and conferences.","01/18/2017","01/18/2017","1727447","Vishal","Saxena","vsaxena@uidaho.edu","01/18/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Idaho","MOSCOW","838443020","2088856651","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Idaho","ID","7564","COMMS, CIRCUITS & SENS SYS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the United States, approximately 85% of mothers with healthy newborn infants express milk within the first four months post-birth, and the majority do so using a breast pump. Yet, the CDC reports that compliance with recommended breastfeeding guidelines is less than 20%. Currently 62% of pump users report problems ranging from insufficient milk extraction to infections. By providing an easier and more comfortable means for pumping neonatal human milk, this project will assist reaching recommended CDC guidelines thereby reducing risks of ear infection, diabetes and intestinal and respiratory viruses in lactating infants and risks of infection in breast-feeding women. By providing means for hands-free milk extraction the technology enables women using breast pumps to remain high levels productivity at home and at work.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project develops a compression based breast pump that improves efficiency and effectiveness compared to current technologies. Pumps for extracting neonatal human milk currently on the market only operate based on suction, leading to discomfort and lower levels of production. The exclusive use of suction is one of the biggest pitfalls of these pumps. In contrast, the technology being proposed uses compression patterns focused on specific areas of the breast that have been shown to be effective in scientific research. This is achieved by closely mimicking motions recommended by lactation experts. The current prototype can actuate to produce a rhythmic compression on a woman?s breast as she pumps using a typical breast pump. The technology combines advances in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, controls, software engineering, materials and user-centered design with a focus on usability, comfort and ergonomics.","01/18/2017","01/18/2017","1719290","Tomas","Isakowitz","tomas@upenn.edu","01/18/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","191046205","2158987293","Research Services","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Deep integration of renewable electricity generation is a key driver of the Smart Grid vision. A fundamental challenge is that these energy sources are highly variable ? they are not dispatchable, experience large and rapid changes, and are difficult to predict. The electricity grid must absorb this variability through a portfolio of solutions that include improved forecasts, demand shaping, electricity storage, optimal grid operations, and new market instruments. Our objective is to analyze this portfolio for wind energy integration. We will develop an analytical framework to study how wind variability can be addressed in competitive electricity markets at deep penetration levels. We will investigate market based wind curtailment, aggregation, matching of variable generation and flexible loads, and novel contract instruments.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The societal impact of our research comes from the fact that renewable electricity generation is critical for energy security and environmental sustainability. Our research directly addresses the obstacles that must be overcome to significantly increase the penetration of renewable generation.

Strong interest in marshes as carbon sinks is likely to spur new programs to offset carbon emissions by restoring degraded wetlands, raising a host of questions concerning whether marsh restorations can successfully rehabilitate other ecosystem functions. A key ecosystem functions of salt marshes is their ability to remove biologically available nitrogen through a microbial process known as denitrification. Biologically available nitrogen is entering coastal ecosystems at increasing rates as a result of human activities such as application of fertilizers and combustion of fossil fuels. When this nitrogen makes its way to coastal waters it can result in a host of negative environmental effects associated with eutrophication, including increasing areas of low oxygen water known as coastal dead zones. The microbes living in salt marshes are able to remove portions of this excess biologically available nitrogen by converting it back to nitrogen gas, suggesting a benefit of salt marsh restoration, however, more information is needed regarding how these microbes may respond to environmental changes associated with restoration. This study will provide new insight on how restoration of a New England salt marsh will alter the capacity of the marsh to remove biologically available nitrogen and will increase understanding of the physiology of the microbes that underlie this critical biogeochemical pathway through a combination of in situ rate measurements, environmental metagenomics, and whole genome sequencing. <br/><br/>The results of this research will provide important new information to restoration practitioners on the conditions that are mostly likely to successfully restore the denitrification capacity of degraded salt marshes so that they reach parity with undisturbed marshes. This work will also enhance scientific infrastructure and knowledge transfer through two mechanisms. First, it will train one early career female scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and two graduate students. Second, research on the denitrification capacity of salt marshes will be incorporated into a First Year Seminar for undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the only public university in the city, which serves a large minority and first generation college student population. This seminar program is designed to increase retention of at risk biology majors by engaging them in research experiences in the early days of their college career. Through collaborations with the Massachusetts Department of Ecological Restoration, the students will meet with stakeholders, design and carry out research in recently restored marshes in the greater Boston area, and report their findings back to the stakeholders. This community-engaged scholarship provides a unique mechanism to disseminate information to stakeholders and it engages students in the scientific process in a way that promotes accountability, generates higher quality outcomes and excites them about the field of ecology.","01/19/2017","04/05/2017","1719446","Jennifer","Bowen","je.bowen@northeastern.edu","01/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Northeastern University","BOSTON","021155005","6173732508","360 HUNTINGTON AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7275","CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7275",NA,NA,NA,"CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The OM separates the periplasm from the external environment and functions as a selective barrier that prevents the entry of toxic molecules such as antibiotics and bile salts into the bacteria. This selective barrier is crucial for survival of bacteria in diverse and hostile environments. This project seeks to acquire an in-depth and molecular-level understanding of how the bacterial OMs behave and work for various types of bacteria, how membrane proteins behave in the OM and interact with the OM, and how solute molecules, especially antibiotics, can enter through the OMs. This will be accomplished using start-of-the-art molecular modeling and simulations. This project will also form the basis for a general approach for molecular modeling and simulation of the OM that will be freely available through the CHARMM-GUI website (www.charmm-gui.org) so that researchers in various disciplines can investigate other important OMs and associated proteins. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary discipline of computational biophysics. In particular, this project will raise the scientific literacy of the public through the publication of research results and workshop participation.<br/><br/>The cell envelope surrounding a gram-negative bacteria's cytoplasm is composed of an inner membrane, the periplasm, and an outer membrane (OM). The OM is unique in terms of having beta-barrel membrane proteins and a highly asymmetric lipid bilayer containing phospholipids in its inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its outer leaflet. This project aims to provide an in-depth and unprecedented understanding of the structural and dynamics of the OMs from various bacteria, interactions between proteins and OMs, and their influences on antibiotic permeation by establishing reliable computational methods for all-atom modeling and simulation of various complex OMs of gram-negative bacteria and membrane proteins in various OMs. The research will found the basis for a general approach of LPS/OM molecular modeling and simulation. This project also seeks to foster synergistic scientific research and education on LPS molecules and bacterial OMs by providing reliable and general computational methods (through LPS Modeler and Outer Membrane Builder in CHARMM-GUI) to students and researchers in the simulation community and other disciplines.","01/20/2017","01/20/2017","1727508","Wonpil","Im","woi216@lehigh.edu","01/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Lehigh University","Bethlehem","180153005","6107583021","Alumni Building 27","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1114","Cellular Dynamics and Function","1114","CELLULAR SYSTEMS","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patten","In this project, funded by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Graeme Henkelman and Richard Crooks at the University of Texas, Professor Anatoly Frenkel at Yeshiva University, and Professor Judith Yang of the University of Pittsburgh are combining experimental and computational methods aimed at discovering optimal bi-functional catalyst formulations and structures for the electrochemical oxidation of the poisonous gas, carbon monoxide. A key element of the research is the use of extremely small catalyst particles (containing only several hundred atoms) that are partially coated with a protective layer of molecules called dendrimers that keep the metal particles from coalescing. A variety of catalysts are being made, and their structures and catalytic activities are being analyzed. Computational studies are being performed to predict new catalyst structures that are then prepared and analyzed; the results from the experimental studies are used to refine the computational methods. The combined approach represents a new toolkit for the discovery and development of new catalytic materials having improved performance.The project participants are involved in educational and outreach activities to engage undergraduate students directly in various aspects of the project including an opportunity for some of the University of Texas - Austin students to spend up to a week at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Pittsburgh. <br/><br/>The research team is conducting density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the entire nanoparticle structure for various combinations of metals - one which adsorbs carbon monoxide and one which adsorbs oxygen dissociatively. The DFT calculations of available reaction mechanisms, together with kinetic modeling and correlations to expected variations in catalyst structures and compositions, identify mechanisms and reactivity descriptors that will be used in subsequent screening-synthesis-characterization-evaluation cycles. Characterizations are being conducted by both in situ and scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Methods are being developed for combining the DFT calculations with the TEM and EXAFS data to improve the determination of nanoparticle structures at the atomic scale. From a scientific/technical standpoint, the study is advancing the dendrimer-aided approach to catalyst synthesis, with a clearer understanding of the nature of the particles that are produced and their catalytic activity. The study is extending previous work on bi-metallic particles to metal-metal oxide systems, with corresponding extension of computational and characterization efforts. The synthesis, characterization, and modeling tools developed during the course of this study have broad applicability to a wide range of reactions and catalyst formulations, and the software tools will be freely distributed to the catalysis science community.","01/23/2017","01/23/2017","1726321","Anatoly","Frenkel","anatoly.frenkel@stonybrook.edu","01/23/2017","Principal Investigator","SUNY at Stony Brook","Stony Brook","117940001","6316329949","WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB","United States","New York","NY","8292","DMREF","044E","CATALYSIS","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","8398","Hydrocarbon Conversion","8400","DMREF","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8396","Clean Energy Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This inability to quickly and conveniently share is particularly a problem in computational geoscience, wherein scientists spend significant portions of their time managing the many input and output files that are typically associated with a model. When developing, testing, validating, and comparing models, particularly coupled models, the number of such data elements and the complexity associated with their management soon outgrows human memory capacity. The unfortunate consequence is that researchers often narrow the scope of a model analysis, compromise research quality, or conduct analysis within restricted teams. This pilot project will demonstrate a mechanism to overcome this challenge in the scientific community.<br/><br/>The GeoDataspace pilot will develop a new data-centric approach to describing models and associated data resources for computational geoscience. This new approach will both simplify model use and enhance the shareability, reusability, and reproducibility of models, data, and computations?properties widely sought by computational geoscientists. Specifically, the project will develop methods for defining, sharing, and accessing geounits, collections of descriptive metadata that define a m the entire collection of files needed to run a computational model, including details about the model run.

A successful outcome of this project will directly benefit society through more effective utilization of information, and thus more sustainable and efficient transportation system planning and operations. This project includes curricula development and student mentoring activities that help better prepare next-generation transportation professionals for challenges brought by the big data era.<br/><br/>Mathematically, the question addressed in this project is: Given directly measurable network parameters x, which tend to be localized and incomplete, how can one infer global network parameters y that are often difficult to be measured directly, with the mapping between y and x built on a complex network structure? This problem category has broad applications in transportation, communication, and energy networks; although, the focus in this project is on transportation networks. Built on knowledge in transportation network science, stochastic optimization, variational analysis, and non-parametric estimation, the research team will pursue the following main tasks: (1) Creation of an optimization framework for network identification based on stochastic optimization and non-parametric estimation; (2) Integration of multi-source traffic data (hard information) with domain-knowledge-based soft information via constraints and functional mapping; (3) Linking historical-data-based offline estimation with real-time information for online estimation and decision support through Bayesian methods; (4) Testing and validating the project's methods using both real-world data and computer simulations. This research establishes a unifying theoretical framework for traffic network identification that integrates knowledge in transportation network science and data analytics. By providing greater modeling flexibility than existing methods in handling various types of hard and soft information and in capturing transportation network physics, this new method ushers a paradigm-shift in traffic network system identification. The project also creates a real-world engineering platform for strengthening connections between optimization and statistics.","01/23/2017","01/23/2017","1719548","Xuegang","Ban","banx@uw.edu","01/23/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","1631","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS","029E","INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS MGT","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","039E","STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research will study the fundamental questions of how to use widely-deployed mobile sensors for (i) estimating/predicting traffic states on arterial networks; (ii) discovering new traffic knowledge and behaviors under normal and post-disaster situations; and (iii) developing path-based dynamic network management strategies utilizing the knowledge obtained from mobile sensors. This research will develop a mobile-data-based modeling framework that will enrich current fixed-location-sensor-based modeling techniques. It will also develop theories, models, and algorithms for path-based dynamic network management strategies, with explicit consideration of multiple equilibria and real time information from mobile sensors, which will bridge various fields such as optimization, network modeling, and control theory.<br/><br/>This research project is expected to transform current traffic data collection and modeling from a fixed-location-sensor-based to a mobile-sensor-based paradigm and will help policy makers and industry make informed decisions on how mobile data can be best used for knowledge extraction and traffic system management. This project will develop new educational tools by integrating project-based learning in the civil engineering curriculum and will develop short courses and research seminars that will foster the communication among academia, government agencies, and industry. This work will conduct outreach activities by disseminating research and education outcomes to a wide audience that includes students in universities and K-12 schools, and in particular students in minority universities.

Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other life that make the reef a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. Corals reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease. Importantly, coral species vary in their susceptible to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown. This project will quantify coral susceptibility to disease by examining coral immunity using several novel approaches and experiments. Seven species of coral that differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates, growth form and reproductive strategies will be used. Immune responses of each species of coral will be measured by exposing the corals to bacterial immune stimulators. Susceptibility to white plague disease, a prevalent disease affecting many species of corals, will also be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague disease and calculating disease transmission rates. The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios. This project will support graduate students at University of Texas, Arlington (Hispanic-serving Institution) and University of Virgin Islands (Historically Black University) and many undergraduate students at all three institutions (Mote Marine Laboratory).

It is often assumed that chlorine enters non-contaminated ecosystems mostly in the form of chloride (the same negative ion in table salt), and that chloride does not interact with plants or soil microorganisms. However, there is growing evidence that chloride is taken up and transformed by plants and soil microorganisms into complex chlorine-containing organic compounds. In environments where oxygen is scarce, some bacteria can use these chlorinated organic compounds instead of oxygen in a form of anaerobic respiration called organohalide respiration (OHR). In this way, these bacteria can quickly use up energy sources that would otherwise be used to produce methane. This means that an active biological chlorine cycle could reduce the amount of methane that is released into the atmosphere. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, trapping about 30 times as much heat per molecule as carbon dioxide. The Arctic region has been warming faster than the rest of the planet, and large amounts of organic carbon are stored in Arctic soils. It is thus important to understand how much soil carbon will be lost to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or methane, since these two gases have different effects on the climate the climate system. This project measures rates of biological chlorine cycling in locations across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, and tests whether organohalide respiration does in fact significantly reduces methane production in these areas. This project could inform models of greenhouse gas emissions, improve understanding of the fate of chlorinated contaminants in Arctic soils, and further the basic science of biological chlorine cycling. The project will involve students at a minority-serving institution (San Diego State University) and a high school teacher, who will lead broader outreach and education efforts.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses the following two questions: (1) Does OHR inhibit methanogenesis via competition for H2? (2) How does the relative magnitude of Cl cycling and its relationship to CH4 flux change along a coastal-inland gradient in the Arctic Coastal Plain? The experimental approach consists of a field survey that compares CH4 fluxes and indicators of Cl cycling along a gradient of coastal influence from Barrow to the foothills of the Brooks Range, and a laboratory incubation experiment to study the relationships among OHR, methanogenesis, other terminal electron acceptor processes, and H2 availability. Indicators of Cl cycling include sizes and transformation rates of soil Cl pools, metagenomes describing the relative abundance of genes and microbial taxa associated with Cl cycling and other anaerobic processes, and 37Cl and 36Cl isotopic analysis to infer the dominant Cl cycling processes and to constrain long-term cycling rates. The laboratory incubation will follow anaerobic processes (OHR, iron reduction, methanogenesis, acetogenesis, and sulfate reduction) in microcosms varying in Clorg and H2 concentration to establish the thermodynamic hierarchy among these processes and whether competition is alleviated by increased H2. ","01/24/2017","01/24/2017","1712774","David","Lipson","dlipson@mail.sdsu.edu","01/24/2017","Principal Investigator","San Diego State University Foundation","San Diego","921822190","6195945731","5250 Campanile Drive","United States","California","CA","5280","ARCTIC NATURAL SCIENCES","7916","EAGER","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. Two keynote lectures will be featured, one from a leading researcher in the field and one focused on practical aspects of grant writing. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. <br/><br/>The field of nucleic acids research is diverse, encompassing research related to the biology of both RNA and DNA. Recent advances in the field reflect this diversity and will be highlighted in this conference, which will bring together scientists who do not often have the opportunity to interact and learn from each other. Among the topics for discussion will be discovery and investigation of an expanding array of non-coding RNAs, as well as new technologies that are being applied to probe reactions and interactions in the molecular machines responsible for diverse processes, including mRNA splicing, protein synthesis, DNA replication, and recombination. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in short talks chosen from the abstracts and in posters. The primary purposes of this conference are to provide a venue for scientific exchange of new research results and ideas among young researchers, to foster learning about emerging paradigms and how they contribute to future goals for research on RNA and DNA biology, and to encourage career development of a new generation of nucleic acids researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.","01/25/2017","01/25/2017","1722796","Eric","Phizicky","lu_han@urmc.rochester.edu","01/25/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Gordon Research Conferences","West Kingston","028921502","4017834011","512 Liberty Lane","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1112","Genetic Mechanisms","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lu","Han",NA,"01/25/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Eruptions, besides their obvious associated hazards, are one of the rare expressions of the dynamics of the Earth over timescales that are easy to comprehend from our standpoint. Over the last decades, our community has recognized the importance of exsolved volatiles (gas bubbles) on the chemical and physical evolution of magmas in the shallow crust and on eruption dynamics. The complexity of volcanic processes and our inability to observe directly how magmas evolve prior and during volcanic eruptions has seriously limited our ability to predict the timing and behavior of volcanic eruptions. With this project, we propose the development of new numerical methods, complemented with fluid dynamics experiments to provide a quantitative understanding of how the exsolution of gases affects the physical properties of magmas, their chemistry (and the composition of gases released to the atmosphere) and ultimately how bubbles behave collectively and affect the behavior of magmas erupting at the Earth surface.<br/><br/>Magmas are multiphase systems composed of a very viscous ambient fluid (silicate melt), crystals and sometimes complemented by exsolved (immiscible) gas bubbles. In order to predict how magmas evolve before and during eruptions, we need to develop dynamic models that allow us to accurately represent the interplay between these three phases under various conditions. In this project, we plan to study first the exsolution and growth of water-rich bubbles to model their effect on chemical differentiation, i.e. how secondary gas phases such as sulfur species and CO2 partition into growing bubbles. The amount of sulfur incorporated into bubbles before an eruption is significant to quantify the impact of eruptions on climate (sulfur is a potent aerosol that affects the radiative balance in the atmosphere). The chemistry of the exsolved gas phase and its participation in a future eruption depend on the efficiency of phase separation in magmas and the possible accumulation of gas bubbles in parts of the reservoir that are more likely to erupt (lower viscosity). Our second task is to study the physics of phase separation, bubble-crystals-melt, more specifically to understand how the magma motion is impeded or facilitated by the presence of discrete bubbles and crystals. Finally, once the rheology of multiphase magmas is better constrained, we plan to use these results and study how buoyant gas bubbles migrate in zoned magma reservoirs. The question we aim to answer is whether bubbles are prone to accumulate in regions of low or high crystal content and how this accumulation affects the chemistry of the gas in the bubbles and the eruptive behavior of the magma.<br/><br/>The results of the proposed research will have broad implications for physical volcanology, petrology, geochemistry and fluid dynamics. It will provide quantitative constraints on the state of magmas stored in shallow crustal reservoirs and also provide a better account of the effect of bubbles on magmas as they ascend to the surface during eruptions. Predictive models for the exsolution of sulfur in magmatic systems can also provide clues as to the climate impact of pre-historical large explosive eruptions (e.g. Toba, Cerro Galan). The goal of the proposed research is to provide quantitative tools and constitutive relations that will be widely available to interpret existing datasets (geochemistry of magmas, rheological experiments on magmas) and transfer this new knowledge to models of magma dynamics. Additionally, the development of new numerical methods to study multiphase fluid dynamics will impact the Computational Fluid Dynamics community and other fields in science and engineering, where particle suspensions or bubble emulsions are important (e.g. effect of fluid dynamics on biology, food processing?)","01/25/2017","01/25/2017","1719480","Christian","Huber","christian_huber@brown.edu","01/25/2017","Principal Investigator","Brown University","Providence","029129002","4018632777","BOX 1929","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1573","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1575",NA,NA,NA,"EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Algebra is a very broad and vital part of mathematics which involves everything from the study of solutions of polynomial equations to the study of subtle abstract algebraic structures. It lays the necessary foundation for other branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory and algebraic topology. This conference is devoted to the recent research activities on the interplay between Noncommutative Algebra with Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Many recent conferences in these areas of algebra have focused on parts of these connections, but this conference will be unique in that it will feature talks on a large variety of topics. The conference will feature over 20 lectures from world-renowned experts, and should attract around 75-100 participants from the international mathematics community. In addition to regular talks by experts, the conference will feature a poster session as a networking opportunity for junior participants. Funding will be prioritized for junior participants and for women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This conference will bring together research leaders in Noncommutative Algebra, whose expertise have connections to Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Focus topic areas include: algebraic deformation theory; cluster algebras and cluster categories; Hopf algebras and their actions on algebras; noncommutative invariant theory; noncommutative projective algebraic geometry; noncommutative resolutions of singularities; and Poisson algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras.

These representations will take into account natural invariances in images, and will lead to novel dictionary learning constructions and algorithms for images and in signal processing in general. These representations will then be used to analyze, search, and recognize similar objects or features in collections of (scans of) paintings, in particular a large collection by the baroque artist Jan Brueghel. The distances between images and portions thereof, the features learned by the extensions of dictionary learning we will construct, and the associated statistical similarities, together with labels provided by experts to be used to train classifiers and algorithms that learn similarities among items to match those provided by expert, will enable us to enrich the current set of capabilities in building these large networks of paintings, to search through them more easily and with more general search patterns, and to visualize them according to different metrics by using dimensionality reduction techniques.<br/><br/>The automatic learning of templates and patterns, and their statistical relationships, in images and signals in general is crucial in a wide variety of applications, such as automating object recognition, and in defining visually meaningful similarities between images, needed to enable searches in large image databases. We will both develop novel techniques for automatically learning good templates for images, that incorporate natural invariances such as translations and scalings, and novel ways of exploiting these templates for analyzing large collections images, measuring the similarities between then, and finding and characterizing recurrent patterns in them. These novel techniques will be applied to the data on the Jan Brueghel Research site, that allows scholars to investigate and conceptualize a very different notion of old master pictures. Instead of creating absolute categories of genuine and not-genuine, the team will be drawing a map of interconnections between the thousands of paintings produced in the workshops of early modern Antwerp. These pictures were made over several generations, in the shops of masters ranging from world-famous (Pieter Brueghel, Rubens) to utterly obscure. The website will chart how ideas were generated, exchanged, reused and retooled by different artists, mapping networks of creation and production well beyond those traceable through archival documents.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1724979","Mauro","Maggioni","mauro.maggioni@jhu.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","Johns Hopkins University","Baltimore","212182608","4105168668","3400 N CHARLES ST","United States","Maryland","MD","1271","COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples. The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing). Indirect influences on neural and dental development, such as gestation length and diet, will also be used as variables.<br/><br/>The broader implications of the study include a web-based atlas and digital archive of histological and CT images from the specimens. The interactive online atlas will be developed as a resource for anatomists, who will benefit from animal models for aspects of human development, and primatologists, who will benefit from the resource on development of primates. In addition, animations which highlight the importance of growth mechanisms for evolutionary adaptation will be created and made available to advanced K-12 students and their teachers as online educational tools.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1728263","Valerie","DeLeon","vdeleon@jhmi.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","1392","Biological Anthropology","1392","Biological Anthropology","7298","COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has demonstrated that strong community ties are linked to civic efficacy, participation, cooperation, and volunteering, and are, therefore, an important measure of social well-being. But recently, researchers have observed dramatic increases in social heterogeneity, weakening ties and potentially underming trust within and between communities. The workshop asks if these developments are inevitable and what the outcomes will be. It addresses these questions using a comparative, community studies approach. Social scientists from the United States, Mexico, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom will use anthropological ethnographic and archival data to examine current shifts in how communities are formed, how they change, and the kinds of ties that are formed within and between them. The work will have impact by 1) increasing understanding of the causes and consequences of community change in the contemporary world; 2) supporting international research collaboration; and 3) promoting education through the inclusion of graduate student participants and by communicating results to the public.<br/><br/>The two-part workshop will be convened by Dr. Jeff Maskovsky (City University of New York) and Dr. Sophie Bjork-James (Vanderbilt University). Community studies experts will share data on how communities across the world are changing and whether those changes strengthen or weaken social ties. The first workshop will seek to answer multiple, interrelated questions: From global perspectives, what are the primary influencers of community change? What social factors have the most impact in strengthening or weakening community ties? How does increased diversity affect community ties? And what can ethnography and history contribute to current debates? The workshop will emphasize a comparative perspective and will develop knowledge of community change across regional, national, international, and global contexts. The second workshop will distill findings and prepare for the publication of an edited volume designed to reach four high impact audiences: students in graduate and undergraduate anthropology courses, anthropologists studying community change, scholars in other disciplines working on similar topics, and the English language reading public.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1724778","Jeff","Maskovsky","jmaskovsky@gc.cuny.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","CUNY Graduate School University Center","New York","100164309","2128177523","365 Fifth Avenue","United States","New York","NY","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sophie","Bjork-James","sophie.bjork-james@vanderbilt.edu","01/26/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Anderson","Wildfires have a tremendous impact on lives and property around the country and the globe. One aspect of wildfires that has not received as much attention is the the smoke plume and how it interacts with the atmosphere. In the late summer of 2016, NSF approved a short deployment of the Wyoming King Air research aircraft to provide airborne measurements of a fire near Boise, Idaho. This award will fund the analysis of that data to determine whether the measurements are able to provide enough information to answer the many outstanding questions about the characteristics of wildfire plumes. The potential impact of the project is on the validation and improvement of fire behavior models, which may allow a safer and more efficient usage of air and ground resources for fighting wildfires. There is also a significant connection between wildfire plumes and aviation and air quality. <br/><br/>The researcher will analyze data collected during the Rapid Deployment to Wildfires (RaDFIRE-2016) campaign which sampled a large wildfire northeast of Boise, Idaho in August 2016. Studies of wildfire plume dynamics and microphysics have mainly been conducted through numerical modeling simulations and observed through ground-based remote sensing. The RaDFIRE campaign was an initial test to determine whether instruments on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft could successfully observe important wildfire characteristics. Initial analysis suggests that the test was successful, but more thorough analysis is needed to determine whether the data is adequate enough to answer unresolved questions about plume dynamics and microphysics. The project fits within the EAGER program at NSF due to the focus on untested but potentially transformative research ideas that employ a radically different analysis approach.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1719243","David","Kingsmill","David.Kingsmill@Colorado.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","1525","PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To many, finding a parking space in these areas is an unpleasant experience of uncertainty and frustration. Cruising for parking makes traffic on already-congested urban streets even worse and leads to significant waste in time and fuel. In transportation, smartphone-based parking management applications have emerged. These applications help drivers find parking spaces by allowing them to use smartphones to view real-time availability and prices of parking spaces and guide them to open parking spaces, reserved or otherwise. This award develops theoretical foundations and methodologies for analyzing these emerging parking management services. Results from this research provide a better understanding of the impacts of advanced parking management services on parking competition and travel patterns.

As populations increase in flood prone areas, communities are becoming more vulnerable to floods. The responsibility for flood management has shifted from the federal to the local level and communities are now responsible for making decisions about if, how, and where to rebuild. Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through reflection, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. By following the response to the September 2013 floods in Colorado communities, this study will investigate how communities successfully learn from extreme events to increase resilience and decrease vulnerability to future floods. The project seeks to contribute to the fields of public policy and natural hazards research with the following objectives: to advance knowledge of policy learning in the aftermath of extreme events; to advance knowledge of disaster recovery, specifically as it relates to the role that community processes, citizens, and other stakeholders play in promoting long-term recovery and resilience; and to inform governments of lessons from flood responses to the September 2013 floods, with the goal of contributing to the effectiveness of governance in flood-affected communities.<br/><br/>The PIs will conduct longitudinal comparative case studies of seven Colorado communities, located in Colorado's three most severely impacted counties from the September 2013 floods. This study will follow communities through their recovery and planning process over a period of three years. Four types of data will be used to examine flood recovery processes and outcomes. First, in-depth interviews will be conducted of participants in the planning and decision process of the community at three intervals during the recovery process.

Current methods for this rely on multi-step and high energy consumption operations. Inspired by the efficiency of biological separation processes that seamlessly capture and transport selective biomolecules, this project seeks to achieve a concerted ""catch and release"" of target molecules from a liquid mixture using responsive polymer-based material systems. The innovation arises from the programmed one-step sorting with low turnaround times. The modular design of the hybrid material system is highly customizable owing to its broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics, and physical simplicity. This project's career development plan provides the foundation for a long-term research program in highly efficient capture and isolation of molecules in flowing fluids. Ultimately, this technology platform may lead to the next-generation in-line separation, sensing, and monitoring technologies and be translated into broader areas of smart technology, robotics, bioengineering, and other autonomous systems. A variety of integrated research and educational activities are planned to develop bioinspired engineering curriculum by integrating the research and online media at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels and to increase public awareness of bioinspired technologies and their societal impacts.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to apply the bioinspired strategy that seamlessly separates biomolecules in a single step to innovate adaptively reconfigurable material systems based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels and to realize continuous ""catch and release"" of target molecules from a liquid mixture. This research explores fundamental questions of molecular binding affinity in different chemical environments that would facilitate the discovery of new adsorbents. To assess the separation performance of the system, quantitative sorting efficiency evaluation, system robustness examination with amenability to multiple separation cycles, and optimization will be conducted. Practically, the systems encompass significant modularity and design flexibility to permit integration and upscaling for broad applications. This research integrates the disciplines of chemistry, materials, and chemical engineering. Diverse education and outreach activities are planned to promote research, education, and awareness related to bioinspired engineering and separation research fields. These include the development of a bioinspired engineering course on campus integrated with an online channel, and female undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students participation in the research project, using existing infrastructure in the ASU High School Summer Academy, the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative program, and public media.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1724526","Ximin","He","ximinhe@ucla.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","1417","Process Separations","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The proposed technology can potentially improve the quality of life and life expectancy by allowing the detection of severe medical conditions (such as cancer) at the early stages. The technology can also be extended to diagnose a large variety of medical situations (such as cardiovascular diseases) at the point of care through optimization of the nanophotonic sensor for the detection of a given set of biomarkers. Beyond point-of-care diagnostics, the possibility of detecting multiple blood biomarkers at a low cost enables transformative fields such as predictive health and personalized medicine. The wide range of potential transformative applications and the extensive range of target customers give a compelling commercial potential to the proposed technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a transformative medical diagnostic technology for the point-of-care detection of blood biomarkers that play a crucial role in detection of medical conditions such as cancer. The target diagnostic system is a low-cost optical bio-chip that can drastically decrease the assaying cost by eliminating or reducing the need for costly and time-consuming amplifications steps in the existing detection technologies. The use of nanophotonic technology for detection of different medically relevant biomarkers enables the development of ultra-compact highly sensitive, and highly multiplexed sensors that are urgently needed for multiple medical diagnostic scenarios, including cancer. The ability to detect multiple blood biomarkers in a reasonable time with high sensitivity and specificity at a low cost will have a potentially transformative impact on healthcare by bringing diagnostic tools at the point-of-care. Among various nanophotonic solutions, the use of highly miniaturized plasmonic nanostructures has the advantage of higher sensitivity and lower cost.

There are areas that do not have continuous access to clean drinking water from a public utility. Often water treatment facilities are not able to easily remove organic contaminants from the water source before the disinfection step and distribution. This technology potentially removes the molecular contaminants that lead to these harmful and regulated disinfection byproducts. The largest commercial impact related to the technology is likely from removing contaminants from water during acute natural or anthropogenic events. Drought or floods can increase contaminants into the natural water supply. Extreme weather can also disrupt water supplies due to flooding, especially when waste water is discharged into the water supply. Industrial accidents like petroleum spills, pipeline leaks, and coal ash pond breaches can disrupt the water supply of an entire city for weeks or longer. The materials and processes developed here can be designed for these acute or emergency management events.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project demonstrates the development of a technology platform to remove molecular and ionic contaminant from natural waters and from treated water. The technology outperforms current methods at removing the smallest molecules that seem to be the most recalcitrant and can be potentially harmful to human health. The intellectual merit of this project centers upon this flexible platform of functionalized materials with controllable morphology. Short oligomers are synthesized with specific functionality to adsorb various water contaminants. These oligomers are functionalized to scaffolding materials and form a contact resin that adsorbs a high capacity of molecular species in a very rapid rate. The ability to control the morphology of the scaffolding allows maintenance of the high surface area exposed to the contaminated water. Moreover, the porosity is kept high enough to allow a fast-filtration method of water treatment.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1724972","Jordan","Poler","jcpoler@uncc.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","CHARLOTTE","282230001","7046871888","9201 University City Boulevard","United States","North Carolina","NC","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mobility and simplicity of the visual display also allow same solution to be used by patients and health care professionals outside the walls of traditional institutions, and in settings where there is currently limited or no access to them. Missed vascular access attempts are estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $6 billion dollars annually, and patient satisfaction is currently tied to Medicare reimbursement. Vascular access is one of the most frequently preformed procedures in hospitals, and the proposed device provides an affordable opportunity for those facilities to improve patient satisfaction across a broad patient population. Blood banks and donation centers rely on volunteers for their supply and the satisfaction of such donors is crucial to their ability to recruit future volunteers or repeat-donors. These facilities are strongly incentivized to provide as positive a patient experience as possible, starting with minimizing the number of vascular access attempts. The device can also be adapted for non-clinical situations, such as emergency or battlefield environments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project uses the unique interaction of deoxygenated blood with light at near infrared wavelengths to create a live, real time video feed of the patients body with the peripheral vasculature clearly differentiated from the surrounding dermal, arterial, and adipose tissue. This allows for practitioners to observe the physical location of the veins, get an estimate for relative vein depth, and observe factors that are known to confound access attempts, such as vascular movement or rolling. This also allows for superior vein location in patients with physical traits or impairments that make vascular access more difficult. A preliminary prototype demonstrates the claims made and rudimentary testing has been completed to demonstrate functionality in a variety of environments.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1725036","Teja","Guda","Teja.Guda@utsa.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at San Antonio","San Antonio","782491644","2104584340","One UTSA Circle","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The acoustic tweezing technology can dramatically improve the quality of care for millions of trauma, major surgery and coagulation disorders patients in the United States and worldwide. When used in petroleum industry, the potential application of the technology is reliable and accurate measurement of rheology and aging of crude oils, which is important for formulating optimal strategies for their extraction and transportation. In chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the technology could be very useful for preparation of polymer materials with required properties and small-scale containerless processing of unique polymer materials that lack impurities generated during polymer contact with solid walls.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a non-contact acoustic tweezing technology in which a drop of a fluid sample is levitated in air by acoustic radiation forces and its time-dependent rheological properties are measured from drop shape changes. Key disruptive features of this technology, tested using the laboratory prototype, are the increased reliability and accuracy due to non-contact measurement, the ability to assess temporal changes in rheological properties during processes such as polymerization and coagulation, small sample volume requirement and relatively short procedure time. The goal of this project is to do focused customer discovery work in the healthcare, petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical industries to evaluate the commercial potential of the acoustic tweezing technology.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1725033","Damir","Khismatullin","damir@tulane.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","Tulane University","NEW ORLEANS","701185698","5048654000","6823 ST CHARLES AVENUE","United States","Louisiana","LA","8023","I-Corps","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project has potential to speed and scale these types of applications on a variety of hardware platforms. The correctness assurance of these applications is enhances by having a variety of implementation variants for different platforms automatically generated, while allowing a single easy-to-maintain version of the software being used as the source for the different implementation variants. These ""automatically improved"" applications can, in turn, enable better knowledge discovery through larger-scale scientific simulations and machine learning, and potentially improve the quality of people's daily lives through better GPS routing and natural language processing implementations.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a system that automatically produces efficient implementation variants of computer software on a variety of different hardware platforms. A graphical user interface is used to permit users to interactively specify the desired application features, provide knowledge about the application source code, and select the appropriate hardware platforms. The project is unique in its interface for supporting interactive communications among software developers, compiler optimizations, and performance tuning of optimizations for varying platforms. While the existing state-of-the-art largely treats compilers as black boxes that optimize a given software application for a single desired hardware platform, this project packages compiler technologies as a collection of optimization tool sets to be used interactively by developers so that optimizations can be applied at a much finer-grained level, specially customized to suit the needs of each application, and better tuned to exploit the varying capabilities of hardware platforms.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1723712","Qing","Yi","qyi@uccs.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Colorado Springs","Colorado Springs","809183733","7192553153","1420, Austin Bluffs Parkway","United States","Colorado","CO","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Terrance","Boult","tboult@vast.uccs.edu","01/26/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, the broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can be associated with giving chemical process designers access to modern optimization techniques. While critical to all chemical companies, optimizing the design of a chemical process (in terms of choosing the process temperatures, pressures, flow rates, etc., that give the best economic performance) is still largely carried out empirically by design engineers. The workflow is typically iterative, labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the optimality of the outcome is not guaranteed. The proposed activity will place at the fingertips of engineers in the chemical, petrochemical, natural gas and other process industries a new computational framework that uses rigorous optimization tools to find the best process design. The commercial potential ranges from increasing the number of process alternatives that can be considered at the design stage, to supporting optimal investment decisions in new production facilities or upgrading existing ones. The proposed activity also has important potential societal impact: investment in US-based chemical production facilities (spurred by recent developments in accessing domestic shale gas and oil resources) will create new jobs and advance the training and development of the current and future workforce engaged in the design and operation of chemical plants.<br/><br/>Applying rigorous optimization tools to solve process design optimization problems has been hindered by numerical challenges posed by solving the process model - a set of very nonlinear equations corresponding to material and energy balances for reactors, distillation towers, heat exchangers, etc. found in a chemical and other process plant. The project relies on a recently-invented computational approach for solving and optimizing process flowsheet models. The approach involves a systematic mathematical reformulation of the model equations, resulting in equivalent expressions that can be solved reliably using common numerical methods. A library of unit operation models which can be linked together to create a mathematical model of an entire process is also available, and has been extensively validated on the design optimization of academic and industrial test problems. The commercialization of this work will bridge the large gap that currently exists between industrial practice and the numerous recent advances in optimization theory.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1723722","Michael","Baldea","mbaldea@che.utexas.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This approach to nanostructure synthesis has applications in biotechnology, energy and tooling, among others. For example, in the healthcare field each year nearly one million people in the United States suffer from an infection related to medical implants. Additionally, implants in bone can loosen over their lifetime due to poor tissue integration, resulting in inflammation and pain, and possibly requiring additional surgeries. These issues can potentially be solved through the synthesis of inherently anti-bacterial biomaterial surfaces that enhance biological tissue integration. The commercialization of this technology has the potential to redefine industrial material design paradigms.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based around a form of plasma processing of materials called Directed Irradiation Synthesis (DIS) and Directed Plasma Nanosynthesis (DPNS). This technology is able to change the inherent properties of a material surface by creating customized nanoscale topographies (pores, rods, cones, ripples, etc.) and chemistries (stoichiometry, oxidation state, etc.) by exposing the surface to a controlled flux of ions, electrons, and neutral particles with controlled mass, momentum, and fluence, among other conditions. This allows a new level of fidelity with atom-by-atom control using self-organized arrangement in irradiated surfaces that is dominated by ion-induced erosion and surface diffusion. This technology will transform the synthesis and design of nano-structured systems by leveraging the composition-dependent mechanisms that drive self-organization on micro- and nano-structures to enable tunability and control of their biological properties.","01/26/2017","01/26/2017","1725029","Jean Paul","Allain","allain@illinois.edu","01/26/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project will use results from more than 30 years of research to demonstrate how network supported, group-based learning grounded in principles of Generative Design can improve learning for all learners, across racial/ethnic backgrounds. The project will also offer detailed analyses of activity designs and implementation strategies that will help pre-service teachers to develop more fully participatory and socially-supported approaches to classroom learning, using authentic STEM practices in group-centered learning environments. This work will be particularly important to advancing knowledge in the field for pre-service teacher preparation, since few pre-service programs use this approach in preparing teachers for today?s classrooms. Through a focus on the initial implementation of twelve model activities taught by pre-service teachers in K-12 classrooms nationwide, this study will also provide concrete and quantitative evidence that group-based learning is both appealing to early-career and induction-years teachers, and that it is feasible to implement in real classrooms.<br/><br/>The project takes a design-based research approach to creating and studying technologies and materials that support generative teaching and learning in STEM.

The research is supervised by two professors from the Center for Language Science at the Pennsylvania State University. This interdisciplinary research project is an important step toward understanding the commonalities and differences between monolingual and multilingual language processing. Bilingualism has historically been treated as its own separate field, but the current study contributes a unique set of data that can be exploited to better understand the cognitive resources that underlie all language processing. A better understanding of bilingual/multilingual linguistic norms is critical for the development of effective teaching curricula and assessments. In addition, the results of this work have the potential to be useful for diagnostic and treatment materials in a clinical setting.<br/><br/>This research incorporates methods from phonetics, corpus linguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to better understand the time course of processes underlying speech production and speech perception. The project uses bilingual language processing as a context that can reveal cognitive mechanisms that are otherwise hidden in monolingual speakers. The specific research questions target the interplay between the neural signature of inhibitory processes, as revealed using Event Related Potentials (ERPs), and the behavioral outcome of that inhibition, as revealed in acoustic measures of speech articulation. The studies take advantage of bilinguals' ability to switch languages mid-sentence. The training component of this project is both theoretical and methodological. The project capitalizes on the Fellow's previous training while simultaneously familiarizing her with the theoretical background necessary to conduct research related to the cognitive psychology of bilingualism, and the methodological training necessary to incorporate neurocognitive and eyetracking methods into her future work.

There will be three extended mini-courses on exciting new research presented by three well-known experts in this field. In addition, sixteen other 30 minute talks will be presented by conference participants. Participants will include graduate students, postdocs as well as more senior researchers. The organizer will conduct a one hour ""problem session"" in which participants pose open problems in the area to stimulate discussion throughout the conference. The goal of the meeting is to bring together researchers working in different, but closely related, fields to disseminate results and initiate new lines of inquiry. As with the successful 2014 Pingree conference, the meeting participants will include a heavy proportion of young researchers who, through the mini-courses, can both learn foundational material and be brought up to speed on new developments. The Pingree Park Campus provides an ideal environment for interaction and thoughtful investigation, fostering research and development in this broad area of research. <br/><br/>The main topic of this meeting will be group actions on zero-dimensional spaces, but related fields in dynamics will also be represented.

Anderson","This award will allow for the investigation of the initiation and propagation of lightning through developing an advanced computer model and code, performing numerical simulations, and conducting theoretical analysis. How lightning originates inside thunderclouds and propagates through air is a longstanding fundamental problem in the field of atmospheric electricity. It has been suggested that there are three critical steps in lightning initiation and propagation: initiation and propagation of streamers that are relatively cold plasma channels, transition from streamers to bright, hot, highly conductive leaders, and propagation of leaders. Recent studies have firmly established that streamers can be initiated from thundercloud hydrometeors subject to the maximum thundercloud electric field measured so far. However, the other two steps of lightning initiation and propagation remain poorly understood. It is unknown whether the streamers originating from thundercloud hydrometeors will be able to generate the first leader at their stem, and if they can, how the streamer-to-leader transition occurs and how this transition depends on thundercloud conditions such as thundercloud charge and field. In addition, experiments and observations have indicated that the most common type of lightning leaders called negative leaders develops in a stepping manner. Perhaps being one of the most ""mysterious"" phenomena in atmospheric electricity, luminous blob structures known as ""space stems"" are found to appear in front of the negative leader tip and they develop into bidirectional ""space leaders"" to support the stepping propagation of negative leaders. There is currently no theory that offers an explanation for the formation of space stems and space leaders.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to develop an advanced computer model and code to study lightning initiation and propagation. A three-dimensional computer code, that includes all required plasma kinetic and gas dynamic components to self-consistently model streamer propagation, leader initiation, and formation of space stems and space leaders, will be developed. With the developed model and code, the following research activities will be conducted: (1) investigating the characteristics of long (>10 cm) streamers propagating in electric fields near or greater than the streamer propagation threshold fields, (2) studying the initiation of streamers from the trail of an expanding, accelerating streamer of opposite polarity and its implications for the formation of space stems and space leaders, and (3) investigating air heating in the channels of streamers originating from hydrometeors, the possibility of the formation of the first leader channel at their stem, and the formation of space stems and space leaders in front of a negative leader.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>Intellectual merit of these activities is defined by the direct attack on one of the most challenging problems in lightning research and by the investigation of the least-understood processes of lightning. With the recent development of lightning experiments, observations and theories, great progress has been made in lightning research. The work will fill a gap in the knowledge of electrical breakdown processes of lightning to further advance the current understanding of lightning, and it will also result in development of an advanced computer model and code that will be used for lightning research for years to come.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>Broader impacts of these activities include: (1) advancement of scientific knowledge in a subject that may contribute to improving the current practice and/or developing new techniques to better forecast severe weather, especially under the increasing pressure of adapting to climate change, (2) improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, (3) development of STEM workforce, (4) participation of women and underrepresented minorities in scientific research, (5) development of simulation software and approaches that will benefit research work in other areas such as laboratory plasma discharges and high-altitude sprites and jets, and (6) broad dissemination of the results in the forms of refereed publications, conference presentations, public lectures and press releases.","01/27/2017","01/27/2017","1728217","Ningyu","Liu","Ningyu.Liu@unh.edu","01/27/2017","Principal Investigator","University of New Hampshire","Durham","038243585","6038622172","51 COLLEGE RD SERVICE BLDG 107","United States","New Hampshire","NH","1525","PHYSICAL & DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY","0000","UNASSIGNED","OTHR","OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Badecker","As the economy, society, and culture of the United States continue to take part in a larger global culture, it is becoming more important to learn languages spoken in other countries, as well as to improve the methods for teaching English as a second language to the families arriving to the United States. Children appear to be better at learning new languages than adults, who instead have very mixed outcomes in how well they ultimately learn a new language. For decades, research has attempted to understand why adults experience more difficulty in learning new languages and what characterizes good language learners compared to less successful language learners, so that we can use this information to improve teaching methods. From this research, we have learned how certain factors contribute to the outcomes in new language learning, but much of the variability remains unaccounted for, suggesting that there is still a piece of the puzzle missing. With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Kinsey Bice, working under the direction of Dr. Judith Kroll, will investigate how individual differences in learning may shape patterns of new second language learning.<br/><br/>The current project will examine how previous language experience combines with general cognitive resources to affect the trajectory of new language learning. Previous research has identified differences in the way that the native language is processed that may contribute to the trajectory of new language learning (i.e., fast and slow language learners), and that may also be affected by how speakers recruit various aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, pattern abstraction) when processing their native language. This project will examine how these differences in skilled language processing predict the trajectory of new language learning, as well as whether the differences are related to variation in non-language abilities. Bilingual speakers, who already have experience with learning a new language and who do not use either language exactly as monolingual speakers do, have previously been found to be better at acquiring new languages, but bilinguals differ from each other in many ways that affect their language learning outcomes. This project will compare both monolingual and bilingual speakers in how they process their skilled languages and how they learn new languages. Behavioral methods and brain potentials will be used to determine whether the brain reflects some learning processes that are not apparent in behavior alone. The bilinguals tested will be typical college students who are taking advanced foreign language classes, as well as heritage Spanish speakers who are raised in Spanish-speaking homes but then educated in English. These two groups of bilinguals represent language experiences that American citizens often encounter themselves, while the monolingual groups will be recruited from parts of the United States that differ in the levels of ambient exposure to foreign languages.","01/27/2017","02/07/2017","1727405","Judith","Kroll","judith.kroll@ucr.edu","01/27/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Riverside","RIVERSIDE","925211000","9518275535","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","8374","DDRI Linguistics","1311","LINGUISTICS","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kinsey","Bice","klb489@psu.edu","02/07/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The accomplishment of this study will provide not only the proof-of-concept but also the ready-to-use bioproduction platform for new means of T cell expansion for clinical immune cancer therapy. The novel technology employed in the rational production process engineering will also be able to provide guidelines and apply easily to the manufacturing of other therapeutic cells. Whereas the results and knowledge obtained in this study will be useful for both the biopharmaceutical industry and academic research, all cancer patients may benefit from the products of this research project. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is to develop an entirely new, metabolic cell process engineering (MCPE)-based, cellular biomanufacturing platform using stirred-tank bioreactor to produce reliable and reproducible large quantities of human T cells for immune cancer therapy, aiming to effectively produce more than 2,000 million T cells with high quality. The traditional T cell biomanufacturing presents several weaknesses: 1) low efficiency of mass transfer that often results in heterologous cellular metabolism, cell viability and product quality; 2) ineffective process parameter control that causes low robustness, reliability and scalability; and 3) lack of critical quality attributes in the early and middle stages of process development, limiting the application of quality by design. This project focuses on developing an innovative stirred-tank-based cellular biomanufacturing platform to produce reliable and reproducible large quantities of human T cells (or CAR T cells) for immune cancer therapy. Supported by Design of Experiment (DoE), proteomics and metabolomics will be applied to evaluate and determine the key bioproduction process parameters (such as stirred-tank parameters, media, supplements, etc.) to control T cell metabolism and cell growth. The oxygen transfer coefficient-based scale-up strategy will be developed to guide large-scale manufacturing of T cells, which will be validated using small- and medium- size tank bioreactors with scale-up factor of 10. In addition, at multiple key steps of the cellular bioproduction, the T cell quality control will be established via monitoring and evaluating cellular density, viability, T cell surface markers and functions. The existing T cell biomanufacturing in flask, LifeCell bag or Wave bag is limited by the weaknesses of lot-to-lot variation, heterologous product quality during scale-up, and low reproducibility. The proposed approach, i.e. MCPE-based fed-batch T cell production in stirred-tank bioreactor, that enables homogenous cell expansion, high cell density, high viability and good product quality in large-scale T cell manufacturing would be a major methodological advance for the field. Moreover, the systems biology approach will help advance the knowledge of host cell protein expression and intracellular metabolite profiling of human T cells under various culture conditions. In addition, the liquid activators in this proposed strategy will avoid heterologous suspension culture, improve cell growth efficiency, simplify manufacturing operation and reduce production cost. The critical scale-up factors learned from this application will guide future large-scale T cell biomanufacturing. Finally, the quality control at multiple stages of the process development will help identify potential product quality and process scale-up pain points during T cell bioproduction. To the PI's best knowledge, this is the first effort to rationally develop T cell bioproduction process via understanding the interaction between cellular metabolism and process parameters.","01/27/2017","01/27/2017","1719625","Margaret","Liu","mliu@uab.edu","01/27/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Alabama at Birmingham","Birmingham","352940001","2059345266","AB 1170","United States","Alabama","AL","5345","Engineering of Biomed Systems","7916","EAGER","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, adhesion forces are largely measured qualitatively. The potential introduction of the instrument into the market will make changes in products quality and the time it takes to develop new products that rely on precise adhesion forces. There are a multitude of potential application areas in the automotive, aerospace, chemical, petroleum, environmental, and medical fields. The irritation of eyes due to the usage of contact lens happens mainly because of the poor adhesion between the lens and the tear drop. The instrument can help the contact lens industry develop contact lenses with better adhesion to the tear drop and therefore reduce the irritation to the eye and prolongs comfortable wear time. Successful implementation of the instrument will enable the industry speed up the development of new products, and build more reliable processes by reducing or eliminating development errors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will identify the key value propositions of a novel adhesion measuring technology for customer segments across several application areas. Key strategic partners and major competitors within the general areas that align with this technology will be investigated. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the new knowledge that will be obtained regarding product development needs for adhesion measurements that will enable development of more sophisticated products that rely on precise adhesion forces. The centrifugal adhesion balance (CAB) instrument will potentially upgrade the adhesion measuring approaches from qualitative estimates to exact quantifiable values. This direct measurement of the adhesion is achieved by using a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces. This combination allows the CAB to produce and measure forces needed for the liquid to detach from the solid. The ability to manipulate forces acting on a liquid drop to obtain accurate measurements of adhesion forces makes CAB a potentially desirable tool for industrial research and product development.","01/27/2017","01/27/2017","1725238","Rafael","Tadmor","rafael.tadmor@lamar.edu","01/27/2017","Principal Investigator","Lamar University Beaumont","Beaumont","777055748","4098807011","4400 Port Arthur Road","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When combined with environment information and transportation information, such human mobility data can be used to develop important applications with broader societal impacts. This project considers technical problems that arise in the context of building an efficient system for bike sharing within a city by concentrating on two data analytics challenges. The first is the prediction of the demand of bikes at different stations. The second is the optimal bike rebalancing strategy among different stations. The successful prediction of bike demand could help system operators better deploy bikes and redistribute bikes among stations. Effective and optimal bike rebalancing could help meet the dynamic need of bike rental and save system operational costs. Although primarily focusing on bike sharing networks, data analytics capability advanced through this problem should be applicable to problems from other types of distributed rental services. <br/><br/>This exploratory research project aims to develop effective and scalable data mining and optimization techniques that have the analytical capability to predict bike demand of different stations and to optimize the bike rebalancing strategy among stations. First, this project aims to develop regression-based prediction models that take into account both relevant features and contextual information such as connections among bike sharing stations. Second, this project explores mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) techniques for solving bike rebalancing problem with the objective of minimizing the total travel distance of rebalancing vehicle. While traditional MINLP techniques could not guarantee feasible solutions, the research team aims to develop advanced clustering techniques to first group stations into clusters and then use the clusters to facilitate MINLP. This project also develops appropriate measures for assessing the effectiveness of the developed solutions. The project offers research based advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. All the data, software, and publications resulting from the project will be made publicly available to the broader research community.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1700263","Yong","Ge","yongge@email.arizona.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Arizona","Tucson","857194824","5206266000","888 N Euclid Ave","United States","Arizona","AZ","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One particularly vexing problem concerns the age of birds. Estimates based on the rate of DNA evolution suggest modern birds started to evolve about 160 million-years ago; the fossil record however, suggests an age that is scarcely older than 66 million years. Explaining the ~100-million-year gap in the fossil record profoundly limits our ability to understand when, how, and why modern bird diversity came to be. This project examines disagreements between molecular divergence time analyses and the avian fossil record, and studies a new hypothesis to explain the observed discrepancy. The project synthesizes data from paleontological and genomic datasets with predictions from population genetic theory. This work also paves the way for an integrative approach to studying evolutionary patterns across other branches of the tree of life. Moreover, the study investigates the effects of the K/Pg (Cretaceous-Paleogene) mass extinction, with important implications for understanding the decimation of Mesozoic dinosaurs and their resurrection in the form of modern birds. Such work may reveal fundamental clues into how and when Earth's modern biodiversity arose. Finally, the researchers will take advantage of the diverse outreach mechanisms at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to communicate their findings to a broad audience.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project, the researchers will study the age of modern birds using a variety of simulation, empirical and theoretical approaches grounded in the study of systematics. The researchers will use recent developments in Bayesian modeling to test the hypothesis that transient miniaturization of body size in the wake of the K/Pg mass extinction can explain a period of molecular rate acceleration in the extinction's aftermath. In the second part of the project, the researchers will study the feasibility of reconstructing unknown life history traits from extant and extinct taxa, conditioned on inferred rates of molecular evolution. A key component of the work will be to advance expertise in distributed high performance computing for phylogenetics, and in analyzing data related to avian life history evolution. In general, the research will leverage the recognition that rates of genome evolution are an important axis of life history variation to promote a progressive approach to studying paleo-life history diversity, and enable the integration of historically disparate information sources. The research will have potentially broad significance to comparative biology and phylogenetics, and may influence the field of divergence time analysis in both the short and long term.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1700786","Irby","Lovette","ijl2@cornell.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jacob","Berv","jsb439@cornell.edu","01/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recognizing biodiversity is important not only for comparative biology, but also because it provides an important decision-making framework for very diverse applied disciplines related to biology, such as agriculture, bioremediation, biophysics, biomedicine (among others). This research proposes to develop a new, widely applicable approach to identifying species using ground beetles (genus Bembidion) as a model. Preliminary data show that species in this group can have large differences in some aspects of the structure of their genomes despite being very closely related. These differences in genome structure are revealed by examining a set of genes (ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes) with modern sequencing techniques. This analysis of 'rDNA fingerprints' costs little to obtain and has potential to help discover new species more efficiently than more traditionally used methods. Results from this research will be used for training opportunities for undergraduate students, as well as a community outreach project involving high school students. <br/><br/>The use of rDNA fingerprints as a species delimitation tool will be validated by profiling additional specimens through low-coverage Illumina sequencing and comparing patterns in rDNA fingerprints to existing species concepts that are built on five gene trees and morphological analysis. The extent of variation in rDNA fingerprints across a wider group of carabid beetles will be explored using a real-time PCR assay followed by additional sequencing of relevant specimens. Finally, the mechanism of copy number inflation within the rDNA cistron will be explored through comparative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), to test the hypothesis that many copies of fragments of rDNA have been transferred to heterochromatic DNA near its boundary with euchromatin.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1702080","David","Maddison","maddisod@science.oregonstate.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Oregon State University","Corvallis","973318507","5417374933","OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY","United States","Oregon","OR","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"John","Sproul","sproulj@oregonstate.edu","01/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Competition for water continues to grow among agriculture, energy production, domestic and industrial uses, leading to water shortages and tradeoffs that have to be addressed. While water deficits can be partially met through wastewater reuse and desalination plants, these methods and their technologies carry unclear threats to the quality and health of our soils, wherein 30 percent of global freshwater is stored. Integrated resources management is an essential tool for these tightly interconnected, essential resources: their interlinkages (the FEW Nexus) must be defined and quantified to enable a holistic understanding of the tradeoffs resulting from different choices about their management and use. This workshop will improve the level of integration of future research, foster national research teams, and build on the investments made toward the creation of a Food-Energy-Water community of science. It will bring together leading stakeholders in the FEW resources Nexus with faculty in science, engineering, and policy disciplines to help identify systems-level conflicts among alternative uses and provide input on the research agenda of the FEW Nexus community. This will help foster new cooperation among science and engineering disciplines for more sustainable management of FEW resources at local, national and international levels to address societal challenges.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Description.<br/>The overall workshop goal is the consolidation of a FEW Nexus Community of Science and creation of a national platform for FEW nexus biophysical, social and policy research to address key challenges in the context of the FEW Nexus. Among the primary workshop outcomes will be the identification of new research and data collection approaches to enhance longitudinal research to model and monitor the processes associated with resilience, vulnerability, and risk reduction. Working groups in the nexus dimensions will establish synergistic research teams to develop joint FEW research proposals for submission to national and international funding agencies. These groups will develop a common Nexus roadmap of science, policy, technology, and education issues critical to the sustainable management of FEW resources. Such a road map is essential for the proper planning and understanding of the tradeoffs among FEW resources. This road map will be developed through an accessible e-portal that is designed to facilitate future engagement with stakeholders and translate knowledge into action. It will also become the foundation of further investigations by providing insight toward new knowledge generated as a result of its implementation. The FEW Nexus community of science will provide a platform from which the Nexus community will share and exchange ideas, draw on international, national, and local FEW nexus efforts, and facilitate the exchange of ideas and development of partnerships for sharing data and information. This will lay the foundation for future FEW Nexus research and allow public, private and scientific sector stakeholders to participate in research to inform decision and policy making.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1707019","Rabi","Mohtar","mohtar@tamu.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station","College Station","778454645","9798477635","TEES State Headquarters Bldg.","United States","Texas","TX","7643","ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY","004Z","Innovations at the Nexus of Food-Energy-","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","8020","Green Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The emphasis of the conference will be on recent spectacular developments in the theory of Drinfeld moduli spaces, Drinfeld modular forms, and their applications. It is hoped that having at the same place and time a large number of researchers with different viewpoints on function field arithmetic will illuminate previously unnoticed connections within the area, thus facilitating future progress. The organizers of the conference will make a strong effort to ensure an active participation of a large number of junior researchers and underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Since their emergence in 1970s, Drinfeld moduli spaces had a tremendous impact on the Langlands program leading to a successful resolution of the global and local Langlands conjectures over function fields. Over the last few years, there has been an explosion of activity in function field arithmetic, with many spectacular results on special values of higher derivatives of L-functions of automorphic forms, special values of Carlitz-Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld modular forms. Moreover, new tantalizing connections have been discovered between different topics of function field arithmetic, such as special values of characteristic p zeta functions, deformations of Drinfeld modular forms, and function field analogue of Fontaine's theory. In many of these works, Drinfeld moduli spaces play a prominent role. <br/>These developments, along with possible future directions of research, will be addressed by the invited speakers of this conference with the hope to inspire new generations to take part in this important and very active area of Number Theory. <br/><br/>Conference website: http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/sfb878/activities/AFF_announce.html","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1709350","Mihran","Papikian","papikian@math.psu.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Pennsylvania State Univ University Park","UNIVERSITY PARK","168027000","8148651372","110 Technology Center Building","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning methods and proving their efficacy. While beneficial, these activities have not fostered the strategies - such as motivation, communication, collaboration, and persuasion - that are necessary if individuals wish to enact change on larger, more institutional levels. These change strategies are well documented in the literature of other disciplines, such as organizational psychology and behavior, but have not been brought into the conversation within STEM education in a rigorous, accessible way. The workshop Making Academic Change Happen (MACH) fills the need of academics for research-based skills development and assistance in creating a plan for change. Through targeted working sessions on specific topics (e.g. partnership development, generating buy-in, institutional context, and identity discovery), participants learn research-proven strategies for making large scale change happen on their home campus. The focus group for the 2017 MACH Workshop is emerging engineering educators. The primary experience of graduate training is to be introduced to disciplinary research and then be provided with a means to gain further competence. We have determined, however, that new engineering educators are tasked with developing new courses, curricula, and programs. These initiatives require additional skills or areas of expertise: advising, mentoring, curriculum development, imaginative vision, program assessment, etc. None of these skills are likely addressed in a typical engineering Ph.D. curriculum. For these reasons, we believe that new engineering educators who envision themselves as change agents should work to adopt the disposition and skills of a change agent. Attending the MACH Workshop will help these educators start on their path as engineering education innovators.<br/><br/>The purpose of this workshop is to assist emerging engineering educators in: 1) learning and practicing skills needed to lead change, and 2) preparing working documents around a variety of topics that are necessary to advance a change project. By fostering the development of these skills and mindsets in the very people who must lead change efforts, this workshop promotes meaningful change in STEM higher education. The change projects advanced by the workshop participants are expected to become model programs that can be mined for examples strategies and processes for others hoping to implement similar ideas. These projects reach beyond a single classroom, focusing more on the underlying processes, approaches, or philosophy of STEM education enacted on their campus. By working within the institution's context, the change agents trained during the MACH Workshop will positively impact the student experience of STEM. As part of this research, the emerging engineering educators will be interviewed about their change projects and provided with mentors and support for their change activities.

Understanding the social forces behind self-organized collaboration is increasingly important in today's society. Technological and social innovations are increasingly generated through informal, distributed collaboration processes, rather than in formal, hierarchical organizations. This project will use a data-driven approach to explore the social and psychological mechanisms that motivate self-organized collaborations and determine their likelihood of success or failure, focusing on the example of open, collaborative software development in online collaborative networks like GitHub (github.com). We offer a mathematically precise model for predicting and testing collaborative dynamics, which builds on a long tradition of sociological theory and research. By accounting for noise and uncertainty in processing social events, this work will make it possible to study the reach of social psychological mechanisms to forms of interaction other than face-to-face communication, where interpretations of events are far less certain, and to cross-cultural interactions.<br/><br/>The research builds on a powerful sociological theory of group processes known as affect control theory (ACT) and a recent probabilistic generalization of it, Bayesian affect control theory (BayesACT). BayesACT applies insights from Bayesian probability theory to explain how people learn and adjust meanings through social experience, and show how stable interaction dynamics emerge from individuals' uncertain and noisy perceptions of their own and others' identities. The model rests on the idea that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: They strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and the cultural beliefs they share with others. BayesACT makes explicit predictions about online interactions in a collaborative group, based on the notion that each group member holds an identity that is learnable, mathematically describable, and complementary to those of other group members. These predictions allow for deeper and more focused data mining, enabling the identification of interactions of specific types in order to answer questions about the very nature of collaboration within online collaborative networks. <br/><br/>The knowledge generated through this project will be widely disseminated online, and through professional presentations and publications. In addition, the project will provide training and mentoring for a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of undergraduate research assistants. It will also contribute to education in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award was made as part of Round 4 of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international funding opportunity designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities.

This conference brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. The conference focuses on novel and recent developments in the application of observations, theory, and numerical modeling and simulation to furthering understanding of coastal ocean processes and our capabilities for their prediction. It is at the coast that human activities are most connected with ocean circulation, and ocean modeling offers great promise for connecting scientific research to societal needs through such efforts as forecasting for marine operations and maritime safety, monitoring and prediction of water quality and the transport and dispersal of water borne pathogens, mapping and characterizing the habitats of marine life, and downscaling global models of climate variability and climatic change to infer their impacts in the coastal zone. The most important broader impact of the conference is the establishment and nurturing of relationships between senior researchers, junior researchers and students. Nearly half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants, to provide numerous opportunities to build these relationships and exchange ideas among people in different age groups, different sub-disciplines of the field, or from different geographic regions. Funds will be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance by under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar formats.<br/><br/>This award provides funding for travel and registration support to U.S. based early-career professionals and students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics which will be held at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine, June 10-16, 2017. This conference, convened every two years now that the former GRC Coastal Ocean Circulation and Coastal Ocean Modeling have been combined, brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. Here the term ""coastal"" refers to estuarine, littoral zone, continental shelf, and shelf-break regions, including mesoscale exchange processes with the adjacent deep-ocean or marginal seas. The topics covered will include: 1) High-Latitude Coastal Dynamics and Exchange Processes; 2) Coastal Modeling and Data Assimilation; 3) Recent Advances in Estuarine Dynamics; 4) Fluxes and Transformation across the Outer to Inner Shelves; 5) Coastal Sediment Transport Processes; 6) Challenges and Successes in Physical Oceanography for the Understanding of Fisheries and Other Ecosystems; 7) New Techniques in Satellite Assimilation and Remote Sensing; 8) Multi-Scale Interactions of Coastal Physics and Biogeochemistry; and 9) Recent Anomalous Ocean Conditions and the Coasts Where we Live. In 2017 the Coastal Ocean Dynamics GRC will be accompanied by a Gordon Research Seminar that specifically targets professional development of students and early career scientists, thereby greatly expanding the broader impact of the GRC itself. New in 2017 is a GRC Power Hour, created to support the professional growth of women in our scientific communities and to build on GRC's history of inclusion.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1723843","Ruoying","He","rhe@ncsu.edu","01/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Gordon Research Conferences","West Kingston","028921502","4017834011","512 Liberty Lane","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1610","PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"John","Barth","barth@coas.oregonstate.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The calculation of real GDP per capita, which is made by the World Bank, is much the same as the calculation needed to obtain an extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day: both calculations must convert spending in a local currency into spending in U.S. dollars. Nominal exchange rates cannot be used for this purpose because they do not take into account the price levels existing in each country. In particular, converting the spending in developing countries into U.S. dollars with nominal exchange rates makes poor counties appear even poorer and rich countries even richer. Instead, it is essential to correct for the lower prices found in poor countries as compared to rich countries. <br/><br/>This project studies the feasibility of using ""Big Data"" methods and online prices to convert spending across countries into a common currency (U.S. dollars), and to establish extreme poverty lines in a common currency (e.g. $1.90 per day). The source of internet price data is the Billion Prices Project (BPP), an academic initiative associated with Alberto Cavallo, one of the principal investigators. The BPP has access to global price information at a very fine level of detail, as is essential in order to compare price for the same goods (e.g. Arabica coffee beans) across countries. These online prices have the potential to improve both the frequency and accuracy of price observations in comparison to traditional price data collection methods, For example, the World Bank currently engages in a labor-intensive collection of prices across countries in what is called the International Comparisons Project (ICP). Because it involves actual visits to stores in so many countries, the ICP can collect prices only at infrequent intervals (the most recent years were 2005 and 2011, with another collection planned for 2017). Furthermore, traditional data collection methods require the cooperation of local statistical agencies and their adherence to strict quality and methodological standards that are often impossible to control. The results will be valuable for the World Bank and other international agencies engaged in measuring real GDP and extreme poverty; for policy-makers that rely on accuracy of these measurements to design and implement solutions; for the work of academics engaged in the Penn World Tables and related international comparison databases; and for scholars from Economics, Political Science, and other disciplines who rely on the measurement of real GDP in various countries. <br/><br/>The main goals of this project are to: a) utilize ""Big Data"" internet sources from the Billion Prices Project to obtain a database of average online prices for comparable products across countries that is independent of the methods used to collect prices by the World Bank; b) to use this online price information to construct measures of the standard of living across countries that can be compared to those from the World Bank, but which will potentially differ due to the new sources of price data; and c) do this at a monthly frequency, rather than once every 6 years, to more accurately track and pinpoint changes in prices and living standards. Large-scale micro-price data from various sources (government surveys, scanner datasets, or web-scraped online sources) have become available for researchers in recent years, but they are not yet suited for comparing prices across countries because prices are not collected according to the same classification or identification system and use differing price collection methods can invalidate international comparisons. The approach will be to access the large-scale, multi-country dataset of prices available at the BPP, build a standardized method for matching products across countries, and develop an appropriate methodology to scale up from individual product prices to an overall consumer price comparison. The project will focus on key practical and methodological issues and lay the groundwork for the use of online price data in research applications that make cost-of-living comparisons across countries. The research will be published in academic papers and the researchers will also publish a monthly database of average price levels in various countries computed during the duration of the project. The investigators will share this database publicly with other researchers via data depositories such as the Harvard/MIT Dataverse. The website of the Penn World Table (www.ggdc.net/pwt) will also provide a platform for disseminating the results from integrating online price information with other macroeconomic data series.<br/><br/>This award was made as part of Round 4 of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international funding opportunity designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities.

The case of emergency medical responders is intriguing and oftentimes problematic. As public service providers, they are street-level bureaucrats who work on the frontlines of the post-9/11 security state, facing political, legal and ethical collisions between the security of the communities where they live and work and their social-humanitarian responsibilities to saving lives. Professional ethics and healthcare laws require that first responders provide help without regard to the legal status of their patients, but as state actors they are also invested with political and symbolic functions of governmental authority and tightly integrated into the federal emergency preparedness and homeland security infrastructures. The study examines the relation between local governments and taxpayers that fund fire, rescue and emergency medical services, and federal and state governments, which set and implement national security, border control and immigration policies. The project will be instructive to EMS-related policy and regulatory efforts as they relate to both broader concerns about national security and public health. The project would also promote the advancement and training of students in methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, while broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. <br/><br/>Dr. Ieva Jusionyte of the University of Florida explores the everyday practices and experiences of first responders - firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics - who work or volunteer for fire and rescue departments on both sides of the Arizona-Sonora border to expand our understanding of the human and social consequences of security policies and border enforcement. This project asks: (1) what effects do security policies, planned and executed at different government levels, have in the communities where they are applied? And (2) how do potential contradictions that result when these policies are put into practice impact border security efforts? Dr. Jusionyte will seek answers to these questions by engaging in a twelve-month-long ethnographic research in rural and urban communities of Southern Arizona, where she will actively collaborate with research assistants and community partners from the fire and rescue departments. The research team will conduct a series of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and archival research in order to explain how conflicting policies at different levels of governance can result in potentially deleterious consequences for people who experience them, and assess the implications that these effects have on first responders as frontline state actors. This research is an original and important contribution to our understanding of the effects of security-making and the laws, politics and ethics of rescue from an anthropological perspective.&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1724749","Ieva","Jusionyte","jusionyte@fas.harvard.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1372","LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","1372","LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1390",NA,NA,NA,"CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If activity levels remain too high or too low for extended periods of time, the communication between neurons becomes unstable, and, as a consequence, new information cannot be learned. Neurons can alter which proteins are present at specialized sites called synapses, where signals are transmitted from one neuron to another. The way that neurons make these adjustments at the molecular level is poorly understood. Recent work has shown that a protein, referred to as GABAb receptor, causes new proteins to be synthesized by the neuron by a mechanism that involves a second protein, referred to as mTOR. This project will determine how GABAb receptors activate mTOR using cultured rat and mouse neurons. Cultured neurons are the system of choice for visualizing changes in protein synthesis at synapses. The project will determine if the GABAb receptor - mTOR interaction promotes changes in synapse number, which then lead to enhanced communication between neurons. The project will provide training for undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral students, including students who are underrepresented in science. It will support development of a new graduate course that trains incoming students in neuroscience laboratory techniques and that gives postdoctoral fellows a formal opportunity to build their teaching skills. Outreach activities are planned through a Community Education Program, Memory Matters.<br/><br/>In the brain, mTOR activity regulates protein synthesis, which is essential for learning and memory. Neurons remodel their synapses (plasticity), to accommodate dramatic changes in activity in order to facilitate new learning (homeostasis). One of the most striking examples of homeostatic plasticity is the formation of new synapses when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inputs are blocked, a mechanism thought to require protein synthesis. Recent work from the principal investigator's laboratory has discovered that during NMDAR blockade, GABAb receptors shift from activating post-synaptic potassium channels to increasing L-type calcium channel activity. The rise in calcium channel activity increases mTOR activity in dendrites. This project will use calcium and fluorescent imaging to define the mechanism that shifts GABAb receptor signaling to activate mTOR (Aim 1 and 2). The project will elucidate whether the functional shift of the GABAb receptor is required for structural changes in synapses and synapse number (Aim 3). The project will elucidate whether the functional shift of the GABAb receptor is required for structural changes in synapses and synapse number (Aim 3). This project will offer new insight into molecular mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1724812","Kimberly","Raab-Graham","kraabgra@wakehealth.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Wake Forest University School of Medicine","Winston-Salem","271571023","3367164548","Medical Center Blvd","United States","North Carolina","NC","7712","ORGANIZATION","1096","NEURAL SYSTEMS","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our proposed center, COSEE Florida: Water as Habitat, will build statewide connections with Florida's ocean research community. This project will provide professional development opportunities for scientists to improve their ability to communicate the value and importance of their science to nonscientific audiences and achieve a better understanding of their role in supporting STEM education.<br/><br/>Founding partners for COSEE Florida are the Indian River State College, the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, and the Florida Institute of Technology. Our content theme ""Water as Habitat"" is engaging and appealing to students and the public and will allow us to place naturally charismatic marine organisms and ecosystems within a systems framework linking physical, chemical and geological ocean processes to biodiversity, marine ecology, climate change, threats to human health, and stewardship actions. COSEE Florida will advance ocean science literacy through the implementation of three strategic initiatives: <br/><br/>1. Professional Development Workshop Series for Scientists: Ocean scientists will participate in workshops to improve their effectiveness in communicating their research to non-scientific audiences. COSEE staff will also provide assistance to scientists who wish to develop quality outreach programs to broaden the impact of their research. Six workshops will be conducted around the state each year. <br/><br/>2. A new Ocean Science Concentration for Pre-Service Educators: Ocean science focused educational content will be added to the Bachelor of Science STEM Education degree for middle school science at Indian River State College in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Students will participate in a suite of courses, research opportunities and high quality practicum situations. The program will be disseminated to additional State College campuses in year 5. <br/><br/>3. COSEE Florida Ocean Science Learning Network: This initiative is the linchpin that brings scientists, educators and the public together to communicate and collaborate. Water As Habitat events will feature ocean-based interactive presentations, educator workshops, and opportunities for continued participant engagement at regional nodes throughout the state. On-line communication tools will be developed to facilitate post-event collaborations and resource sharing. At least five regional Learning Community nodes will be established around the state. <br/><br/><br/>Our work will engage a spectrum of people and organizations from across Florida. Ocean researchers, higher education faculty, informal education institutions, educators and the general public will participate in a wide range of activities. Through our initiatives we will (1) involve up to 90 Florida ocean scientists in effective outreach and education each year, (2) expand the skills and strengthen the ocean science content of at least 200 pre-service undergraduates, 100 in-service teachers and 100 informal educators over a 5 year period, (3) improve the ocean literacy of over 3000 Florida residents and tourists and (4) learn from and contribute to the work of other Centers in the National COSEE Network. <br/><br/>The ocean science content of our programs will draw on current research findings from Florida's leading ocean scientists (Intellectual Merit) and significantly expand public awareness of the significance of their work (Broader Impacts).

The researchers take methods from computer science and put them to work with tools and methods from speech science, linguistics and digital humanities to find out objectively how much the sounds of English dialects across the Atlantic vary now and in the past. Scholars across the humanities and social sciences already routinely analyze huge amounts of written English quickly and easily. In fact, the electronic tools for searching texts and, within seconds, obtaining summaries that one can see are available to anyone. However, speech research is only now entering its own ""big data"" revolution. Past linguistic research tended to carry out detailed analyses of a few aspects of speech from one or a few languages or dialects. The current scale of speech research studies has shaped our understanding of spoken language and the kinds of questions that we ask. Today, massive digital collections of transcribed speech are available from many languages, gathered for numerous purposes: from oral histories to large datasets for training speech recognition systems to legal and political interactions. Sophisticated speech processing tools exist to analyze these data, but they require substantial technical skill. Combining these data and tools allows linguists to answer fundamental questions about the nature and development of spoken language. <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to establish the key tools to enable large-scale speech research to become as powerful and pervasive as large-scale text mining. This ability to quickly and easily analyze speech in many English dialects should be applicable in computational, forensic, and clinical approaches to speech, and forensic and clinical speech applications, and useful to literary scholars, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, political scientists.

The active layer in polymer-based solar cells is usually prepared by arresting the phase separation of a polymer/fullerene blend. The structures formed with this non-equilibrium process are difficult to control and accurately characterize, so it is hard to understand how film morphology influences the device efficiency. This award will develop three integrated tasks to investigate the effects of domain size, interfacial area and polymer crystallinity on charge generation, recombination, and transport processes, respectively. First, conductive polymer nanostructures are prepared by electron-beam patterning. These nanostructures are solvent-resistant and thermally-stable, and variables such as nanostructure geometry, polymer crystallinity, and polymer cross-link density are all tunable. Second, the optoelectronic performance of model nanostructure/fullerene solar cells is evaluated with established spectroscopic and device characterization techniques. Last, domain size, interfacial area, and crystallinity are accurately quantified with detailed analysis of X-ray scattering data. A particular focus of this work is interfacial engineering: It is hypothesized that polymer/fullerene interfacial composition profiles can be controlled through polymer cross-link density (in addition to annealing temperature and time), offering a simple route to study the effects of interfaces on charge generation and losses. The knowledge acquired through these systematic studies will identify the optimal design attributes for a benchmark polymer/fullerene system and guide morphology optimization for a variety of high-performance materials. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Polymer-based solar cells show promise for low-cost solar energy conversion, but the technology will not be viable as an alternative source of energy until the power output is improved. This research program facilitates those improvements by establishing a system to study the relationships between active layer structure and electronic function. These findings will help optimize the efficiency of polymer-based solar cells. Education and outreach activities are integrated with this research program in four ways. First, the PI encourages research participation for a diverse pool of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and participates in numerous K-12 outreach programs that introduce polymer science to under-represented groups in science and engineering. Second, students will be equipped with the necessary skills for multidisciplinary research through a new nanofabrication course and a multi-institutional workshop that will teach the fundamentals of X-ray scattering. Third, through connections to the local Houston materials industry, students will learn about commercialization of polymers for energy conversion and storage. Finally, to enhance the global awareness of student participants, the PI will coordinate complementary research collaborations with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.","01/30/2017","01/30/2017","1731292","Gila","Stein","gstein4@utk.edu","01/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","1773","POLYMERS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7644","ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY","9161","SINGLE DIVISION/UNIVERSITY","AMPP","ADVANCED MATERIALS & PROCESSING PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unlike previous work in this area, this project considers swarms of microswimmers instead of single vehicles, and allows fluids with non-ideal behavior characteristic of, for example, mucus. The results will be experimentally validated using a controllable synthetic biofluid. The results will guide future development of control systems for microrobotics, and advance towards practically controllable magnetic microswimmers in vivo. A complimentary outreach program will provide and cultivate a unique, interdisciplinary training environment for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, exploiting eye-catching microswimmer control, drug delivery, and haptic devices.<br/><br/>The PI has recently demonstrated that achiral magnetic rigid geometries are capable of propulsion when rotated by a magnetic field. This project builds upon that demonstration, by formulating the motion control problem in the setting of stochastic differential equations, in order to create a stochastic control system for 3D motion and swarm control of magnetic microswimmers. Motion control of microswimmers is accomplished with magnetic control and computer vision feedback. Notably, variations in the physical parameters of the individual microswimmers will be leveraged to address uncertainty in the fluid environment. The approach will be used to formulate control and coordination schemes for the motion of a large number of microswimmers in heterogeneous 2D and 3D workspaces, using motion planning and control frameworks that address issues such as controllability and optimality. The results will be experimentally validated in a non-Newtonian fluid with controllable parameters that simulates a biological environment.","01/31/2017","03/29/2017","1712096","MinJun","Kim","mjkim@lyle.smu.edu","01/31/2017","Principal Investigator","Southern Methodist University","Dallas","752750302","2147682030","6425 BOAZ","United States","Texas","TX","7569","Dynamics, Control and System D","030E","CONTROL SYSTEMS","034E","Dynamical systems","8024","Complex Systems","116E","RESEARCH EXP FOR UNDERGRADS","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9231","SUPPL FOR UNDERGRAD RES ASSIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Itsweire","Observational oceanography involves the sampling of a global turbulent fluid. Relevant length scales range from the size of ocean basins down to the millimeters where turbulent dissipation occurs. Time scales of interest are as small as seconds to climate fluctuations of decades or centuries. A relatively new approach to address the challenges of sampling this broad range of scale is to use autonomous platforms, defined here as being unconnected either to a ship or the seafloor. The trends in autonomous and Lagrangian platforms and sensors (ALPS) have been apparent for some time. This recognition led to the initial NSF-sponsored ALPS workshop in 2003 and it is timely to revisit its findings. In 2003, the Argo array had only 900 floats on its way to the current array of more than 3500. Underwater gliders were being developed, but no real science had been done with them yet. Propeller-driven AUVs were beginning to deliver results. A wide range of biogeochemical sensors was discussed at the meeting, mostly as possibilities, although there were some results from floats. Many of the predictions in the ALPS report have proven to be accurate, with a marked increase in the number of scientists using autonomous platforms to address research problems. The ALPS-II meeting will take place at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, during 21-24 February 2017.The outcome of ALPS-II will be broadly shared with the ocean scientific community. In pursuit of this objective, the meeting will be as open as possible subject to the limited number of on-site participants. A website will make publically available all meeting materials, including the final report. The plenary sessions will be broadcast on the internet. Importantly, all workshop participants will be encouraged to consider the interests of the broader community in their contributions. Meeting recommendations are expected to include means to make ALPS technologies accessible to more scientists. If fully successful, the results of the meeting will be a catalyst towards the adoption of ALPS widely throughout the ocean community, both for research and operations.<br/><br/>This second ALPS science and technology review has the overarching goals (1) to survey progress in the past 13 years, and (2) to assess future prospects. The meeting will examine the ALPS enterprise through a sequence of slices through a rapidly growing field. The history and potential of the various platforms (drifters, floats, gliders, autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles) will be addressed. The various classes of sensors including physical, biogeochemical, optical, acoustic, etc. will be reviewed with special attention to their use on autonomous platforms. The scientific problems amenable to ALPS technologies will be discussed including global and regional issues, high latitudes, ocean acidification, and climate variability. The value of ALPS in ocean forecasting will be a topic of interest, including approaches for adaptive sampling and control. Models for managing and operating ALPS assets will be discussed, with the goal of making the technologies available to more scientists. This brief list of topics is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive, as meeting participants will have latitude to guide the meeting.","01/31/2017","01/31/2017","1722716","Daniel","Rudnick","drudnick@ucsd.edu","01/31/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography","LA JOLLA","920930210","8585341293","8602 La Jolla Shores Dr","United States","California","CA","1610","PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1680","5293",NA,NA,"OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN","AON IMPLEMENTATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Black","Waves exist in space plasmas just as in the oceans and the atmosphere. In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth.","01/31/2017","01/31/2017","1723588","Wen","Li","luckymoon761@gmail.com","01/31/2017","Principal Investigator","Trustees of Boston University","BOSTON","022151300","6173534365","881 COMMONWEALTH AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","5750","MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, advancements have continued to be made in earthquake engineering by observing the effects of large earthquakes in countries that have similar seismic design standards and well-constructed infrastructure. Documenting the effects of earthquakes in a country like New Zealand, which has rigorous building codes and similar infrastructure to the U.S., provides the greatest opportunities for learning lessons that will be directly transferable to our country. The Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake provides a unique opportunity to evaluate in considerable depth the effects of earthquake shaking on diverse types of infrastructure, in cities of different population densities, underlain by various types of soil profiles, subjected to a wide range of shaking intensities. These circumstances provide an invaluable opportunity to study ground shaking amplification caused by site, basin and topographic effects, and cases of liquefaction-induced ground failure, that will be directly applicable to U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Salt Lake City. Urgency is required because the PIs currently have access to some key facilities, such as the CentrePort of Wellington. After they have rebuilt the port, for example, there will no longer be access and the opportunity to characterize the ground as it was immediately after the earthquake will be lost . Moreover, New Zealand researchers are rapidly mobilizing to carry out initial studies at key sites. In order to combine resources and expertise, the project will need to also mobilize quickly. The end-goal of this project is to benefit society at-large through increased resiliency, sustainability and affordability of civil infrastructure via improved seismic design. This work will also serve to strengthen international research collaborations between the U.S. and New Zealand, and will provide U.S. graduate students with rewarding international travel experiences that will serve to balance their technical education and expose them to the globally-connected problems that still exist in earthquake engineering. In short, the broader impacts of this work stretch far beyond the borders of New Zealand and will positively impact seismic hazard practices in the U.S. and abroad.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the research plan include an improved understanding of: (1) ground motion stratigraphy, basin and topographic effects in complex geotechnical settings; (2) liquefaction response of gravelly soils; (3) the influence of non-liquefiable capping layers on liquefaction damage potential; and (4) the response of buildings and critical port infrastructure on liquefiable soil. Of particular interest are the much-higher-than-expected long period ground motions recorded on natural and reclaimed soil sites 60 km from the fault rupture in the capital city of Wellington.

Without this information, it will be impossible to place observations of structural damage and ground failure caused by the Kaikoura earthquake in context. Wellington is the perfect test bed for this study, because abruptly changing topography allows all of these ground motion effects to be studied on a remarkably small scale of several kilometers.

Fragaszy","A large and widely-damaging earthquake has not occurred in the U.S. for over 20 years. However, advancements have continued to be made in earthquake engineering by observing the effects of large earthquakes in countries that have similar seismic design standards and well-constructed infrastructure. Documenting the effects of earthquakes in a country like New Zealand, which has rigorous building codes and similar infrastructure to the U.S., provides the greatest opportunities for learning lessons that will be directly transferable to our country. The Mw7.8 Kaikoura earthquake provides a unique opportunity to evaluate in considerable depth the effects of earthquake shaking on diverse types of infrastructure, in cities of different population densities, underlain by various types of soil profiles, subjected to a wide range of shaking intensities. These circumstances provide an invaluable opportunity to study ground shaking amplification caused by site, basin and topographic effects, and cases of liquefaction-induced ground failure, that will be directly applicable to U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Salt Lake City. Urgency is required because the PIs currently have access to some key facilities, such as the CentrePort of Wellington. After they have rebuilt the port, for example, there will no longer be access and the opportunity to characterize the ground as it was immediately after the earthquake will be lost . Moreover, New Zealand researchers are rapidly mobilizing to carry out initial studies at key sites. In order to combine resources and expertise, the project will need to also mobilize quickly. The end-goal of this project is to benefit society at-large through increased resiliency, sustainability and affordability of civil infrastructure via improved seismic design. This work will also serve to strengthen international research collaborations between the U.S. and New Zealand, and will provide U.S. graduate students with rewarding international travel experiences that will serve to balance their technical education and expose them to the globally-connected problems that still exist in earthquake engineering. In short, the broader impacts of this work stretch far beyond the borders of New Zealand and will positively impact seismic hazard practices in the U.S. and abroad.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the research plan include an improved understanding of: (1) ground motion stratigraphy, basin and topographic effects in complex geotechnical settings; (2) liquefaction response of gravelly soils; (3) the influence of non-liquefiable capping layers on liquefaction damage potential; and (4) the response of buildings and critical port infrastructure on liquefiable soil. Of particular interest are the much-higher-than-expected long period ground motions recorded on natural and reclaimed soil sites 60 km from the fault rupture in the capital city of Wellington. It is hypothesized that highly variable topography, both above and below the valley floor, resulted in complex interactions between stratigraphy, basin and topographic effects, amplifying ground motions. Advanced site characterization is needed in the form of deep shear wave velocity (Vs) profiling and topographic array studies to investigate these phenomena. Without this information, it will be impossible to place observations of structural damage and ground failure caused by the Kaikoura earthquake in context. Wellington is the perfect test bed for this study, because abruptly changing topography allows all of these ground motion effects to be studied on a remarkably small scale of several kilometers. Advanced site characterization is also needed at Wellington's port facility, where surprisingly severe liquefaction damage occurred under moderate shaking (PGA values of 0.13 - 0.24g) from this relatively distant earthquake In addition to documenting the damage to wharves and shipping cranes due to liquefaction-induced lateral spread movements, there are rare incidents of gravel liquefaction to document at CentrePort Other important ground failure sites on the South Island should also be characterized rapidly to add valuable, perishable data to the U.S. soil liquefaction triggering and lateral spreading empirical databases. Advanced site characterization studies are planned at key case history sites in Wellington and the South Island using a combination of: (1) Single-station horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio noise measurements for investigating fundamental site periods, (2) Combined active-source and ambient-wavefield surface wave testing for developing deep Vs profiles; (3) Cone penetration tests for revealing detailed site stratigraphy; and (4) Direct-push crosshole tests for high-resolution Vs and Vp profiles.

Citizen CATE is a program to observe the total solar eclipse that will track across the United States on August 21, 2017 from 60 locations distributed along the path of totality. Total solar eclipse crossings of the United States are relatively rare events; the last time a total solar eclipse crossed the Continental U.S. from the Atlantic to the Pacific was June 18, 1918. While a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any one particular location, Citizen CATE will have 60 identical sites manned by trained citizen-science volunteers. The goal of the experiment is to produce a continuous white-light movie of the inner solar corona for a period of about 90 minutes. The resulting data set will provide a scientific resource to further study the dynamics of the corona, and an educational resource for the training of future researchers and for outreach to the general public. The academic partners that will be involved in the Citizen CATE experiment are drawn from a geographically and demographically diverse set of institutions. These diverse partners will, in turn, reach out to an even broader audience from small rural events to international broadcasts viewed by thousands. <br/><br/>Never before have the continuous observations of the inner solar corona like those proposed by the Citizen CATE project been performed. Some of the areas of solar research that will be addressed by such a data set include: the study of polar plume dynamics, measurement of the coronal potential field, examination of the relationship between coronal smoke rings and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the search for active-region loop oscillations, and the search for the signatures of coronal inflows. After the eclipse, the CATE data will be transmitted back to a central location at the PIs institution, the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, CO, for further processing and distribution to the scientific community for further research. A quick-look movie of the Citizen CATE results will also be made available to the general public on the day of the eclipse. The CATE data will open a new window on the inner solar corona and will provide valuable context data for future eclipse studies. Because the equipment that is used by the volunteers for the eclipse observations will stay with the institutions, the project will have lasting effects on STEM education well beyond the 2017 event. Students from across the country will be engaged in solar physics and astronomy research and education. The project will, thus, serve to inspire and train the next generation of astronomers.","01/31/2017","01/31/2017","1732227","Matthew","Penn","mpenn@nso.edu","01/31/2017","Principal Investigator","Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.","Washington","200040000","2024832101","1331 Pennsylvania Ave. NW","United States","District of Columbia","DC","1214","PLANETARY ASTRONOMY","043Z","PPSR- Public Participation in Scientific","1207","OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Robert","Baer","rbaer@siu.edu","01/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michael","Pierce","mpierce@uwyo.edu","01/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jameson","Image reconstruction and feature extraction have been important aspects in various applications such as medical resonance imaging (MRI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, these procedures involve challenges. Different applications may vary in data acquisition (sampling) domains, levels of detail required, and processing domains for the features of interest. The data acquisition is usually under-prescribed and noisy. The sampling domains and/or processing domains may not be well suited for the underlying question. All of these make the problems ill-posed, and various regularization techniques are necessary to study the problems by formulating them as convex optimization models. This project will develop an integrated framework of investigating such convex optimization models. The project will provide graduate students with opportunities for training through research involvement and will prepare them for careers in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The PIs aim to propose a systematic way of evaluating various regularization techniques in such models, conduct a rigorous numerical analysis of the models, and develop efficient numerical algorithms of solving the models. Specifically, the PIs will address the following technical questions: (1) What constraints must be placed on the collected data in order to construct a numerically robust approximation to the underlying function? (2) How quickly and in what sense does the approximation converge? (3) Are the corresponding numerical algorithms developed for the fidelity and regularization terms viable? (4) How well are perturbations from the original data tolerated?

This research project will investigate the tree of life of living and fossil groups of marine snails, and the changes that happened in the shape of their shells through geological time. Snail shells are an iconic example of an organisms' effective defense against predators. With more than 30,000 described living species and countless fossils, snails are the most diverse group of invertebrate animals in the oceans; the diversity of their shell forms being equally impressive. Their rich fossil record shows a transition of shell features starting in the middle of the Mesozoic Era, around 160 million years ago. At that time, while dinosaurs thrived on land, fishes and crabs with increasing capacity of crushing shells were diversifying in the oceans. Changes in shell shape are thus hypothesized to be an evolutionary response to increased predation. If predation pressure was indeed an important driver during the evolution of shell shape, a general dominance of better-defended forms would be expected after the mid-Mesozoic. The researchers will gather data from an ample set of shells from fossil and living species to infer how they are related to each other and to estimate the times of origin of snail groups with different shapes; these results will be used to investigate the trajectory of the shell shape during the Mesozoic. Results from this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and science blogs broadly accessible to the public. A large number of shell images will be produced and made available online, including websites for science communication. In addition, high school and undergraduate students will be mentored in their first experience in science.<br/> The members of Vetigastropoda, the specific group of marine snails under study (including abalone, key-hole limpets, top-shells and others), present great variation in shell height and level of coiling. Shorter and less coiled shells are particular features that could offer mechanical resistance against shell crushing. This study will test the hypotheses that: (1) the morphospace of shells became more restricted in response to predator selective pressure, and (2) the trajectory of shell shape trended towards shorter and less spired forms. Hypothesis testing will be accomplished by adding shell morphological data to a molecular phylogeny inferred from high-throughput sequence data. The fossil data will provide the basis for estimating divergence times in the phylogeny of vetigastropods, and for the comparison among distinct models of trait evolution.","02/01/2017","02/01/2017","1701648","Tauana","Cunha","tauanacunha@g.harvard.edu","02/01/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gonzalo","Giribet","ggiribet@g.harvard.edu","02/01/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this reason, mosquitoes have an enormous impact on humanity, as illustrated by the recent episodes of local Zika virus transmission in Florida and Texas, and the epidemic in Latin America. Preventing and mitigating the effects of mosquito-borne pathogens requires a detailed understanding of the interactions between mosquitoes and hosts. Globally, there are around 3,500 mosquito species, each with distinct preferences for certain hosts. Some take blood from any available vertebrate, but most prefer only certain animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, even fish). By understanding these relationships, researchers can assess how a pathogen moves through an ecosystem, and predict the risk of human infection. To investigate mosquito-host interactions, researchers use a method called blood meal analysis. Mosquito blood meals contain the DNA of their hosts, which is used to determine the host animal's identity. While these data provide insight on pathogen transmission, they can also improve understanding of vertebrate host communities. Results from this research will be disseminated via social media platforms and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A graduates student will be trained and involved in all aspects of this work.<br/><br/><br/>The taxonomic composition of host DNA within a sample of mosquito blood meals reflects the vertebrate host community. Data generated through mosquito blood meal analysis are traditionally collected, analyzed, and interpreted under an epidemiological context. Following the emergence of methods for molecular species detection and environmental DNA analysis, host DNA derived from the blood meals of hematophagous invertebrates has been recognized as a source of molecular data that is informative to vertebrate conservation. This research integrates epidemiological methods of mosquito blood meal analysis and vertebrate diversity assessment, with the aim of generating datasets that are simultaneously valuable to both conservation and the characterization of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission networks. Current blood meal analysis approaches rely largely on polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing of the DNA barcoding regions of host genes. Because host DNA derived from the mosquito gut is inherently degraded by digestion, next generation sequencing approaches are likely to enhance the ability of making successful identifications. This research will identify the hosts of mosquitoes collected at two sites in Florida, Everglades National Park and the University of Florida campus, through next generation sequencing. Mosquito blood meals will be used to characterize the host communities of both sites, detect the presence of Burmese pythons and other invasive vertebrates in the Everglades, and enhance the understanding of relationships between mosquito species and host communities.","02/01/2017","02/01/2017","1701975","Lawrence","Reeves","bereaves@ufl.edu","02/01/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","1198","Biodiversity: Discov &Analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akito","Kawahara","kawahara@flmnh.ufl.edu","02/01/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a concrete example one can consider the trajectory of a ball on an ideal table. The table is frictionless and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. A classical mathematical problem is to study the trajectories of a ball when the sides of the table form a polygon - not necessarily a rectangle. There can be different types of trajectories. Some trajectories can be periodic and some can be dense on the table. This simple problem is notoriously difficult. It is very difficult to solve the problem for a particular table, unless it is of a special shape; for example, a rectangle or an equilateral triangle. This leads to the study of families of tables that have similarities. You could for instance, study the family of tables with five sides. Taking the family of tables as a new space it is possible to define a new flow on this space. This point of view turns out to have important consequences. For example, we may now be able to say what happens on ""most"" tables. This proposal studies dynamical systems by taking a similar point of view.<br/><br/>We mainly seek rigidity results where rather weak initial data about an object yields an almost complete classification of the object. The following will be the main objectives: <br/>(i) Employing a dynamical approach to study problems in number theory and geometry has proven rather fruitful. However, this approach is often noneffective. <br/>We will seek effectivization of the rigidity phenomena for the action of groups generated by unipotent subgroups on homogeneous spaces; these rigidity results have served as one of the main tools in the aforementioned applications. <br/>(ii) There is an action of the group of nonsingular, real, two by two matrices on the moduli space of a compact Riemann surface; this is closely related to the asymptotic of the number of periodic trajectories on rational polygonal tables. <br/>This proposal seeks generalizations of the recent exciting developments which proved certain rigidity results for this action. <br/>(iii) We attempt to investigate dynamics on homogeneous spaces with infinite volume, and on homogeneous spaces arising from local fields of positive characteristic. There are various geometric and number theoretical applications which motivate the study of these spaces.","02/01/2017","03/30/2017","1724316","Amir","Mohammadi","ammohammadi@ucsd.edu","02/01/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clusia plants have a number of notable characteristics that make them important for study. In addition to being one of the few trees and shrubs to grow on other plants (epiphytes), Clusia is the only known tree group to have Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis in which carbon (CO2) is absorbed during the night, when temperatures are lower and water loss is reduced. It is also one of only two groups of flowering plants in which flowers of some species produce floral resins instead of nectar as reward for pollinators. This project seeks to use genome-wide DNA sequence data to understand how species of Clusia are related to each other, and to estimate the evolutionary history of CAM photosynthesis and floral resins in the group. Results will enable the researchers to understand patterns of plant adaptation to water stress, and provide new insights into the evolution of pollination reward systems. Taken together, these results will permit a better understanding of how plants have evolved and how they have adapted to different environments. One graduate student and an undergraduate will be trained in molecular systematic and anatomical methods.

The funding will partially support the attendance of US scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. Participating students will be selected following a competition on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. The workshop and competition will inform the manufacturing community of the ASTM E60 Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing, provide an opportunity for practitioners to put the standards into practice when modeling processes of interest, and provide a source of candidate models to populate the repository that will be developed by NIST and its partners for the use of the manufacturing community.<br/><br/>This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty members, and, especially, women and under-represented minority students and faculty. The workshop focuses on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. All manufacturing processes, whether batch, continuous, or discrete event type, and all size scales, nano- to macro-manufacturing, will be considered. Models can span from traditional scale down to nanoscale processes and be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies. Since sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost, time and environmental considerations, many different types of process performance metrics may be considered. It is anticipated that the workshop and associated modeling competition will advance the field of advanced manufacturing and its relationship to sustainability to a significant extent.","02/02/2017","02/02/2017","1719289","Alexander","Brodsky","brodsky@gmu.edu","02/02/2017","Principal Investigator","George Mason University","FAIRFAX","220304422","7039932295","4400 UNIVERSITY DR","United States","Virginia","VA","018Y","CM - Cybermanufacturing System","016Z","Cybermanufacturing Systems","081E","NANO SCALE ASSEMBLY","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC","084E","NANOMANUFACTURING","1468","MANUFACTURING & CONST MACH EQP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1468","1788","7643",NA,"Manufacturing Machines & Equip","NANOMANUFACTURING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY","1788","Nanomanufacturing","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","7643","ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The neural crest and cranial placodes are temporary structures in growing embryos that together build all the nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord, such as the nerves that control the gut, the sense organs enabling our senses of smell, hearing and balance, and also the eye lenses, much of the skull, some cells of the teeth, and all skin pigment cells. The conference sessions will discuss the evolutionary origins of these essential structures, and how they work during development to form these different types of cells and organs. The NC&CP GRC is held in a setting that allows scientists at all levels to discuss problems and advances in studying these embryo structures. The program will also allow opportunities to mentor young scientists of all backgrounds, including an informal forum to discuss the professional growth and challenges women face in science, and a Graduate Research Seminar organized and run by junior scientists. This seminar enables junior researchers to present their data in an informal, peer-group setting, so they gain confidence and camaraderie, and includes a faculty-led Career Mentorship Panel discussion, ""The Different Faces of Academic Research."" A diverse set of speakers has been assembled, with 19 further talks, selected from submitted abstracts, to be presented by women, under-represented minorities, and junior researchers.<br/><br/>The Neural Crest and Cranial Placodes Gordon Research Conference (NC&CP GRC) uniquely considers two distinct embryonic cell types, the neural crest and the cranial placodes, that have traditionally been studied separately. These embryonic structures together contribute to a wide variety of cell types during development, including the entire peripheral nervous system, sense organs, pigment cells, the craniofacial skeleton, and teeth. Neural crest and cranial placodes are derived from adjacent domains within the early ectoderm and their initial patterning is influenced by coordinated signals. They provide integrated, experimentally tractable systems for investigating a broad array of fundamental questions in cell, developmental, evolutionary, and systems biology. Study of neural crest cells has pioneered the understanding of fundamental properties of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions as well as cell migration, and has been instrumental in defining general stem cell properties across numerous tissue populations. The use of systems biology methods to construct the gene regulatory networks that control vertebrate development has been pioneered in the study of neural crest and cranial placodes. The emergence and diversification of the neural crest and cranial placodes is thought to have been critical for vertebrate evolution. This conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists in a collegial atmosphere to foster substantive discussions and promote collaboration. It will accelerate the exchange of information across different model systems, include an evolutionary perspective, promote technological innovations, and advance understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms governing the formation, cellular behavior, and differentiation of these two critical embryonic populations.","02/02/2017","02/02/2017","1724546","Clare","Baker","cvhb1@cam.ac.uk","02/02/2017","Principal Investigator","Gordon Research Conferences","West Kingston","028921502","4017834011","512 Liberty Lane","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1119","ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7712",NA,NA,NA,"ORGANIZATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Glinert","Access to mathematics education is critical to facilitating careers in the sciences, engineering, technology, and in many professions, as well as to providing the mathematical literacy needed in everyday life. The PI's goal in this project is to increase real-time access in the classroom to mathematical material for low vision students (who are visually impaired but not blind), which is currently mostly lacking as these students must primarily rely on assistive technology and human note takers to provide access to course materials after the class meeting. The PI's approach is to bring together expertise in computer science, mathematics, and accessibility to provide a useful and usable solution to this problem for the iPad. Called AccessMath, the prototype application will provide zoom-able camera views as well as a view of notes written at the whiteboard (captured by a Mimio), which may be altered through magnification and contrast adjustment features. The system will support consulting and searching course content during lecture, including textbooks, handouts, notes written at the whiteboard, and audio in video (e.g., to find the word ""eigenvalue"" in recorded lectures for the course). A novel note-taking facility will be employed, where notes are represented on note ""cards"" that can be attached to a specific location in the current view (e.g., at a spot in the whiteboard view), then manually moved, resized, rotated, stacked, and ""flicked"" out of view, providing a natural means for interacting informally with notes created during lecture. Notes are created as blank cards, or as cards containing views of whiteboard data, video excerpts, or existing notes. Notes are also used in constructing search queries. Linear algebra (in particular matrices) is the pilot scope for the project, due to the many challenges in conveying a matrix, individual items within the matrix, following derivations, and the scale of the matrix needed when completing non-trivial problems. AccessMath users will have a single iPad which connects to a server providing video feeds and recognition and retrieval services.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: AccessMath will assist low-vision students with mathematical instruction in and out of class, at the high school and university levels, by providing immediate access to lecture materials, including searches for mathematical content in whiteboard notes, handouts, textbooks, and lecture videos (through word spotting in audio). The system will afford student ownership in note taking and customizing access, which will be significantly better than current solutions, and will reduce or eliminate the extent to which visually impaired students fall behind their sighted peers in the classroom setting. The project will also advance the state-of-the-art in recognition and retrieval for mathematical notation, and will create a novel note-taking model using the metaphor of photos on a tabletop, which should be applicable to domains other than mathematics.","02/02/2017","02/02/2017","1708718","Stephanie","Ludi","stephanie.ludi@unt.edu","02/02/2017","Principal Investigator","University of North Texas","DENTON","762035017","9405653940","1155 Union Circle #305250","United States","Texas","TX","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT","7923","SMALL PROJECT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding how these interactions with other species have shaped an organism over time is key to understanding how and why that organism is the way it is today, which is fundamentally important to understanding the complexity and diversity of nature and very useful when trying to control an organism with an economic consequence. Many types of wasps inject their eggs into the body of another living insect, which hatch into larvae that consume the host. Wasps in the subfamily Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) use a specialized virus, polydnavirus, to prevent their hosts, caterpillars, from destroying their eggs and larvae. Microgastrine wasps are one of the most important ecological and agricultural natural enemies to the caterpillars of butterflies and moths, including many agricultural pests. This research will compare the genomes polydnaviruses from a small group of closely related microgastrines. This group of microgastrines was at one point a single species that attacked 1-3 species of host caterpillars, but evolved over time into about 20 species that each attack different caterpillar species. The goal of this project is to identify which virus genes changed the most and which changed the least as this group of wasps evolved into several different species which have adapted to different hosts. This will identify which virus genes have universally important functions for disabling caterpillars' immune defenses and which genes may have specific functions that are adapted to work in a specific host. This will contribute to understanding how polydnaviruses help microgastrines adapt to new host caterpillars, how they are able to adapt to thousands of different caterpillar immune systems, and why there are so many species of microgastrines. This is especially important for understanding why some groups of organisms evolve into many more species than other groups of organisms, and for discovering new ways to control caterpillar species, many of which are important agricultural pests.<br/><br/>Polydnavirus genes that interfere with host immunity are hypothesized to evolve rapidly in an evolutionary arms-race with the host immune adaptations. Polydnavirus genomes are integrated into the microgastrine wasps' nuclear genome. Parapanteles Ashmead is a small microgastrine genus with well-studied microgastrine host use patterns. A draft genome of Parapanteles continua has already been sequenced and assembled and putative polydnavirus genes have been identified within it. This research will sequence and assemble the genomes of 20 more Parapanteles species, annotate their polydnavirus genes, and phylogenetically investigate how these genes have evolved, especially in relation to host-switches.","02/02/2017","02/02/2017","1701925","Kyle","Parks","kparks4@illinois.edu","02/02/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"James","Whitfield","jwhitfie@life.illinois.edu","02/02/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, many wastewater treatment plants are discharging treated wastewater containing significant amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate ions, directly into the water system, posing significant threats to the environment. Large-scale algae production represents one of the most promising and attractive solutions for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuel production. The critical bottleneck is low algae productivity and high biofuel production cost.<br/><br/>The previous work of this research team has successfully developed an algae membrane bioreactor (A-MBR) technology for high-density algae production which doubles the productivity in an indoor bench-scale environment. The goal of this project is to explore advanced cyber-physical sensing, modeling, control, and optimization methods and co-design of the A-MBR system to bring the new algae production technology into the field. The specific goal is to increase the algal biomass productivity in current practice by three times in the field environment while minimizing land, capital, and operating costs. Specifically, the project will (1) adapt the A-MBR design to address unique new challenges for algae cultivation in field environments, (2) develop a multi-modality sensor network for real-time in-situ monitoring of key environmental variables for algae growth, (3) develop data-driven knowledge-based kinetic models for algae growth and automated methods for model calibration and verification using the real-time sensor network data, and (4) deploy the proposed CPS system and technologies in the field for performance evaluations and demonstrate its potentials.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate a new pathway toward green and sustainable algae cultivation and biofuel production using wastewater, addressing two important challenging issues faced by our nation and the world: wastewater treatment and renewable energy. It will provide unique and exciting opportunities for mentoring graduate students with interdisciplinary training opportunities, involving K-12 students, women and minority students. With web-based access and control, this project will convert the bench-scale and pilot scale algae cultivation systems into an exciting interactive online learning platform to educate undergraduate and high-school students about cyber-physical system design, process control, and renewable biofuel production.","02/02/2017","02/02/2017","1702394","Piya","Pal","pipal@eng.ucsd.edu","02/02/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","8235","CPS-Synergy","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hardware is at the most fundamental abstraction level on which software runs. Trusted hardware platforms comprise the backbone for successful deployment and operation of these infrastructures. Research in recent years shows that as tampering and reverse engineering mature in their sophistication, the challenges in guaranteeing the trust and security of these components also grow. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) aims to continue its role as a premiere forum that invites novel solutions to address these challenges. <br/><br/>Security attacks are growing in sophistication, and increasingly target hardware. Backdoors inserted into electronic designs can allow for silent intrusion into the system. Furthermore, new forms of attacks that exploit side-channel signals are being developed. In addition, intellectual-property (IP) protection is becoming a major concern in the globalized, horizontal semiconductor business model. The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Preparation has begun for HOST 2017 to be held in the Washington, DC Metro Area. This project provides opportunities for 36 students to receive travel support (i.e., registration, transportation, and lodging) to attend HOST 2017. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs).

In addition, many herbivores are pests that eat agricultural plants or compete with livestock for food in rangelands. Past research has focused on three factors that might control herbivore communities: 1) the total amount of plant material available for them to eat, 2) the number of different types of plants available for them to eat, and 3) how much nitrogen and phosphorus (two important nutrients known to be important to herbivore growth) is available in plant material. However, knowing these three things about a particular location has not proved to be enough information to allow scientists to accurately predict how many and what type of herbivores will be present. Recent research has suggested the possibility that other micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, and sodium may help explain how herbivore communities are structured. In the past, scientists thought that these other nutrients were common enough in all plants that they would not affect herbivores. This research will test the hypothesis that some of these micronutrients help to determine the identity and densities of herbivore communities. If this hypothesis is supported, it will suggest novel explanations for what controls herbivore abundance and species composition, which may be helpful for agricultural applications.<br/><br/>Soil micronutrients may benefit or harm herbivores directly (by affecting plant food quality) or indirectly (by altering plant community composition). Preliminary data from a coastal tallgrass prairie in Texas showed that foliar micronutrients were better predictors of herbivore community structure than were plant biomass, diversity or macronutrients, and that soil micronutrient concentration affected feeding of grasshoppers when host plant identity was held constant. This project will support a large, multi-factorial field experiment in a coastal tallgrass prairie located south of Houston that will rigorously test the importance of micronutrients in mediating herbivore abundance and diversity, and determine if the importance of micronutrients 1) depends on macronutrients and 2) varies among herbivore feeding modes and guilds. Complementary mesocosm and laboratory experiments will test potential mechanisms of micronutrient effects; that is, whether micronutrients affect herbivores directly or indirectly. This study will be the first to manipulate macro- and micronutrients in concert for understanding insect community structure, and will do so in the field at an unprecedented scale.","02/03/2017","02/03/2017","1724663","Chelse","Prather","chelse.prather@gmail.com","02/03/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Dayton","DAYTON","454690104","9372292919","300 COLLEGE PARK AVE","United States","Ohio","OH","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project examines the way organisms colonize and adapt to extreme environments, namely freshwater caves. Caves are hostile habitats where adaptation at the genetic level is essential for survival. Cave organisms commonly have a special set of traits collectively known as 'troglomorphy,' which include changes in both form (reduced dependence on eyes, longer legs and antennae) and function (tolerance to low oxygen, better sense of smell). These traits in combination with the geographical isolation of caves make them a perfect study system to answer long-standing questions on adaptation, and species diversification. This project uses genetic methods to study the geographic distribution of two crustacean species (Asellus aquaticus and Niphargus hrabei), which have populations that can be found in surface waters and freshwater caves throughout Europe. In order to better understand how these species colonized and adapted to life in darkness, this project will identify the important genes that play a role in troglomorphy, and examine how they are controlled (switched on or off). The identification of genes that are switched on or off when exposed to different conditions (surface vs. caves) will help to clarify how genetics and environment ultimately come together to drive the form and function of living organisms. Additionally, cave ecosystems often contain rare, or new, species that are left undiscovered due to the difficultly of accessing and studying these habitats. Unfortunately, many cave species are endangered (pollution, habitat destruction, overexploitation of aquifers, etc.), and the opportunity to gain knowledge from these ideal study systems is quickly vanishing. In addition to the scientific knowledge generated during this project, it will also result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art molecular laboratory techniques and computational analyses. The computer software developed for these analyses will be made available online, providing other researchers with the opportunity to use these new resources. Exploration of these caves will likely result in the discovery and description of new species. Photo and video footage gathered during these expeditions will be made public as a documentary highlighting cave exploration and research. Results from this project will be offered in a series of public seminars and outreach activities. Impacts from this research will aid in the understanding of these important but very threatened ecosystems and will help us better understand conservation needs for the organisms in these systems.<br/><br/> The unique characteristics of aquatic caves and of their predominantly crustacean biodiversity nominate them as particularly interesting study subjects for evolutionary biologists. The present study capitalizes on a perfect natural experiment, the Molnar Janos thermal cave system in Budapest, Hungary. This intricate freshwater cave system and the immediately adjacent Malom Lake present the ideal opportunity to address questions of colonization, adaptation, and evolution. Despite marked environmental differences between the cave and surface waters, both localities are inhabited by natural populations of two emerging model cave species, the isopod Asellus aquaticus and the amphipod Niphargus hrabei. This project aims to employ these populations' phylogeographic histories as robust frameworks on which to evaluate the transcriptional and epigenetic basis behind the adaptive divergence of traits involved in troglomorphy, namely vision and chemoreception. This investigation will be undertaken using comparative DNA methylation (BsRADseq) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approaches. The identification and evaluation of differentially expressed/methylated genes and pathways will provide a solid bridge between genotype-phenotype, and aid in the understanding of patterns of molecular evolution in cave systems. The results will depict, in a phylogenetically informed context, a close to complete picture of the molecular basis behind vision and chemoreception in A. aquaticus and N. hrabei, of the role these traits play in cave adaptation, and of the evolution of troglomorphy in the subphylum Crustacea.

Notholaenids ferns become dormant during the dry season but quickly rehydrate and restore photosynthetic activity when moisture returns. This drought adaptation is hypothesized to be related to a waxy substance called 'farina', primarily composed of plant pigments, that form a whitish-to-yellowish layer on the leaf undersurface. When leaves curl up in response to water stress, this leaf surface is directly exposed to sunlight. Two primary functional hypotheses for the waxy layer have been proposed: 1) it acts as a 'barrier' to help reduce water loss from evaporation; 2) it acts as a 'sunscreen' to protect water-stressed leaves from damage caused by overheating and UV-radiation. This study aims to investigate the evolution and function of farina in notholaenid ferns and address a critical gap in understanding how plants cope with drought stress and high solar irradiance by using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, biogeographical, ecophysiological, and molecular phylogenetic approaches. These data will provide new insights into the functional role of farina on fern leaves and drought resistance more generally that may be applied to other plant groups. One graduate student will be trained in a diversity of approaches, and a new undergraduate training module will be developed using ecological niche modeling to investigate the patterns of plant evolution. <br/><br/>This study has three primary objectives: The first is key to understanding the evolution of farina in this group, and involves reconstructing the interspecific phylogenetic relationships among notholaenid ferns using DNA sequences from both nuclear and plastid markers. Objective two will focus on Notholaena standleyi, a widespread species with three well-recognized flavonoid chemotypes. The phylogenetic relationships, flavonoid constituents, ploidy levels, and geographic distribution of these chemotypes will be explored to determine whether polyploidy and abiotic niche divergence have helped to shape their current parapatric distributions. Objective three will investigate the proposed ecophysiological functions of farina by measuring gas exchange rates, water-use efficiency, and photosynthetic-recovery rates after drought treatment, before and after removing the farina. Detailed anatomical and optical properties of farina will also be examined.","02/03/2017","02/03/2017","1701942","Tzu-Tong","Kao","tk117@duke.edu","02/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Duke University","Durham","277054010","9196843030","2200 W.

Members of the lobelia plant family (Lobeliaceae) restricted to the Hawaiian Islands have undergone a remarkable divergence in habitat, growth form, leaf size and shape, floral morphology, and mechanism of seed dispersal, and are considered one of the best examples of an adaptive radiation in plants. Previous studies have shown that this group of 140 species was derived from a single colonization 13 million years ago, long before many of the Hawaiian islands of today had emerged from the Pacific. Hawaiian lobeliads now represent 12% of the native Hawaiian flora and are the most species-rich plant lineage found on any single group of oceanic islands on Earth. The two largest genera, Cyanea and Clermontia, comprising approximately 100 species form the largest sublineage within the group. Previous phylogenetic analyses of Cyanea-Clermontia were inconclusive due to a combination of limited sampling within the group and insufficient DNA sequence variation to reconstruct a well-supported estimate of relationships. Cyanea-Clermontia, by its very size, ecological and morphological diversity, and high proportion of species restricted to single islands (each of known age), offers unique opportunities for studying adaptive radiation, speciation, and historical biogeography. Understanding relationships within this lineage could provide new insights into the rise of plant and animal diversity on Hawaii, and identify traits associated with a tendency to become rare or extinct. This project will (1) broadly train a graduate student in plant systematics and historical biogeography analyses; (2) develop molecular phylogenetic analysis pipelines to aid in the study of other recent radiations; (3) produce a well-documented collection of DNA samples to permit future studies of this important group; and (4) create a website on the diversification of native Hawaiian lobeliads, to disseminate findings to a broad range of amateur botanists and lobeliad enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Next-generation DNA sequencing data will be used to infer phylogenies of Cyanea-Clermontia from whole-chloroplast genomes and >400 nuclear genes for all living species sampled across their range. Analyses of these data will permit derivation of species trees and networks, analysis of hybridization, introgression, and other forms of reticulate evolution (important in Clermontia), reconstruct its geographic spread through time, and infer the pattern and tempo of evolution of key morphological and ecological character-states using a variety of tree- and network-based approaches.","02/03/2017","02/03/2017","1702007","Steven","Hunter","steve.hunter@wisc.edu","02/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Wisconsin-Madison","MADISON","537151218","6082623822","21 North Park Street","United States","Wisconsin","WI","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Thomas","Givnish","givnish@facstaff.wisc.edu","02/03/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary product of this work will be a re-description of P. physalis, which also aims to address some of the following questions: how are zooids organized in P. physalis? How does P. physalis zooid morphology and colony organization differ from other siphonophore species, and what does this suggest about their evolution? Physalia physalis colonies have highly 3-dimensional branching structures. Optical Projection Tomography, as well as other immuno-fluorescent imaging methods, will be used to 3D-image fixed P. physalis tissue.

Blood","Large infrequent disturbances, such as hurricanes, significantly alter coastal forests through damaging winds and salt water carried with the storm surge. Depending on the frequency of the hurricanes and concurrent extent of the wind damage and salt water intrusion, coastal forests can be significantly damaged and may transition into salt water marsh. With a more variable climate system, hurricane return times will decrease and projected increasing sea level rise will enhance the opportunity for salt intrusion. Current understanding of hurricane effects is based largely on the effects of a single hurricane; few studies exist that document effects of repeated storms in one location or that separate the effects of storm surge from wind. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew hit the South Carolina coast in largely in the same area affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, thus providing an opportunity to study multiple hurricane impacts on the same coastal forests. Hurricane Matthew differed in intensity and areas inundated with salt water. The project will introduce newer remote sensing capabilities to expand the studies to understand the short term and long term impacts on structure and functioning of the affected forests and at larger landscape and regional scales. This project's timely field assessments of wind damage, salt stress, soil chemistry, tree functioning, and tree establishment coupled with the remote sensing will test theoretical predictions and advance understanding of large infrequent disturbances on coastal forests. <br/><br/>Large infrequent disturbances may structure forest ecosystem responses for very long periods of time and may trigger threshold responses that cause multiple paths of ecosystem response or even shifts in complete ecosystem structure and function. Much of the theory devoted to hurricane disturbance effects on coastal forest ecosystems arises from the study of single hurricanes or immediate response following the hurricane. Empirical tests and data are needed to evaluate multiple hurricanes across short and long time and site to regional space scales to fully understand the recovery and trajectories of change. This project leverages data and research sites from a long-term field study of coastal ecosystems to examine the consequences of the Hurricane Hugo on the recovery from wind throw and salt stress. The new studies will examine how wind damage and the salt intrusion from Hurricane Matthew affected soil processes, forest mortality and succession, forest functioning, and invasion of non-native species in response to differential hurricane disturbance. The remote sensing will assess forest structure, stress, phenology, and plant traits across the marsh/forest landscape and at multiple study areas along the coast of South Carolina. This work will provide critical tests of disturbance theory, succession, ecosystem structure and function across multiple space and time scales.","02/03/2017","02/03/2017","1725377","Thomas","O'Halloran","tohallo@clemson.edu","02/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Clemson University","CLEMSON","296340001","8646562424","230 Kappa Street","United States","South Carolina","SC","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES","7914","RAPID","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Skip","Van Bloem","skipvb@clemson.edu","02/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bo","Song","bosong@clemson.edu","02/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","William","Conner","wconner@clemson.edu","02/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The intriguing geometrical shapes of familiar crystals such as snowflakes and diamond are dictated by regular molecular packing. The smallest unit of the crystal, the unit cell, repeats itself in straight lines across three dimensions to grow these stunning objects. But what if the available space for the crystals to form is non-flat, i.e. curved? How could the unit cells be accommodated and how will the structure be distorted? The molecules have to make turns as they pack into the crystalline lattice, and the shape and properties of the resultant crystals will vary. This project is concerned with such a scenario, and aims to understand the fundamentals on how polymer crystals are formed in a very small and curved space. The PI has recently shown that hollow crystal capsules can be formed by crystallizing polymers on the surface of liquid droplets. These unique capsules are termed ""crystalsomes"". In this project, crystallization from solution will be conducted in small liquid droplets. Crystallization conditions and the molecular structure of the polymers will be systematically varied to control the shape and size of the crystalsomes, whose structure will be studied using a number of advanced instrumental techniques. It is anticipated that well-controlled crystalsomes may find applications in the fields of nanomotors, drug delivery and gene therapeutics. The educational component of the proposal includes: (1) Developing two class modules which will be used in an Advanced Polymer Characterization course; (2) Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students; (3) Involving high school students and teachers, particularly from under-represented populations, in the proposed research activities; and (4) Engaging in local outreach activities to enhance broader interest in science and technology. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Crystallization is a ubiquitous self-assembly process in nature. By definition, crystallization implies that a unit cell self-repeats in a three-dimensional (3D) lattice following translational symmetry. A curved space, on the other hand, is intrinsically incommensurate with 3D translational symmetry. Recently, the PI's group observed a unique type of crystalline morphology in a miniemulsion system. Polymer crystallization was found to be confined within and directed by the curved liquid/liquid interface. Polymer single crystal-like capsules were obtained and the structure mimics the familiar polymersomes. The term ""crystalsome"" was coined to describe this unique structure, and the goal of the proposed work is to systematically investigate the structure and crystallization behavior of these peculiar crystalsomes. The specific aims of the proposal are to understand 1) the single-crystal growth mechanism in miniemulsion-solution crystallization systems, and 2) the crystal structure and chain packing in these curved crystalsomes. In this project, a variety of tailor-designed crystalsomes will be fabricated using the novel miniemulsion solution crystallization method. The crystalline morphology and structure of these crystalsomes will be systematically investigated using X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy. It is anticipated that this project will lead to clearer understanding of the mechanism of polymer crystallization at nanosized and curved liquid/liquid interfaces.","02/03/2017","02/03/2017","1709136","Christopher","Li","chrisli@drexel.edu","02/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Drexel University","Philadelphia","191021119","2158955849","1505 Race St, 8th Floor","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although an increasing number of researchers have begun to understand what drives uneven diversity between species, few researchers have examined how differences within single species can affect these broad scale evolutionary patterns. One source of variation lies in the difference between the sexes. The primary goal of this research is to build upon evolutionary theory by examining how sex differences contribute to species and phenotypic diversity. This research fills a critical gap in our understanding of how variation within species may drive larger patterns of species diversity. Through this research program, scientists will contribute to training the next generation of students through their mentorship of high school students through the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP), undergraduate student training in the Small Mammal Undergraduate Research in the Forest (SMURF) program, public talks through the Santa Cruz Public Library, and undergraduate teaching in Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy. <br/><br/>The skulls of musteloids (badgers, otters, raccoons, skunks, and weasels) will be used as a model to examine the effects of sexual dimorphism on phenotypic disparity at the macroevolutionary scale. Musteloids are a taxonomically rich and phenotypically disparate clade whose lineages exhibit uneven patterns of diversity. The researchers will use 3D geometric morphometrics and develop new comparative methods to test the hypothesis [H1a] that incorporating the effects of sex will reveal increased cranial disparity. Males and females in each species are predicted to occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of cranial morphospace; furthermore, the inclusion of both sexes will fill morphospace that was previously unoccupied when the analysis focused on a single sex. The researchers will then quantify the rates of cranial disparity through time in males and females separately and pooled together (species means) to test the hypothesis [H1b] that incorporating sex enhances the pattern of adaptive radiation (i.e. rapid increases in evolutionary rates near ecological opportunity followed by a slowdown in rates). A rate shift in cranial evolution is predicted to occur just after the onset of the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition when using the pooled male and female dataset. Lastly, the researchers will examine an ecological basis for sexual dimorphism by testing the hypothesis [H2] that the degree of carnivory corresponds with the evolution of sexual dimorphism in cranial shape and size across Musteloidea. Therefore, hypercarnivorous musteloids are predicted to exhibit the highest degree of cranial sexual dimorphism. We suspect that this disparity in hypercarnivores is present to mitigate competition between the sexes.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1700989","Chris","Law","cjlaw@ucsc.edu","02/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of California-Santa Cruz","Santa Cruz","950641077","8314595278","1156 High Street","United States","California","CA","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rita","Mehta","rsmehta1123@gmail.com","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Resources relating to food and feeding, also known as trophic resources, have been a leading factor in driving the diversity of life on this planet. One of every three living vertebrate species is an acanthomorph fish, a group of spiny-ray finned fishes that includes cichlids and many reef fishes. Members of this group consume a wide variety of resources, ranging from scraping scales off other fish, filtering plankton from the water, biting off chunks of coral, or actively hunting other vertebrates. How effectively the fish feed on these resources is intimately connected to their physical anatomy, especially how well the fish can maneuver and capture prey. Some anatomical traits are thought to lead to increased speciation or decreased extinction rates (these are known as key innovations) but may limit possible flexibility in diet evolution. This is the key question addressed by this research. In addition, this research compares how communities of different ages are shaped by their trophic ecologies. Acanthomorphs are also common aquarium fish, providing a great opportunity to educate the public about form and function in biology, which this research will do by producing interactive software.<br/><br/>Understanding the ecological factors that generate and maintain diversity is a major goal in biological research. Trophic ecology is one such factor and is a major driver of evolution. Acanthomorph fishes provide the perfect system to study trophic evolution as they are extremely speciose and diverse in their trophic ecology and morphology. Specifically, this research investigates how trophic ecology may promote or constrain rates of morphological evolution, how morphological key innovations may constrain or promote rates of diet evolution, and how communities of different ages may have different patterns of trophic evolution that have shaped the respective fish fauna. This research will use comparative phylogenetic methods and, for young radiations, phylogenomics, to elucidate relationships of species and test these hypotheses in a comparative evolutionary framework. This research will provide insight into how diet evolves and the macroevolutionary consequences that trophic ecology has on morphology.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1701913","Brian","O'Meara","bomeara@utk.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Samuel","Borstein","sborstei@vols.utk.edu","02/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Melanesian forest frogs provide an ideal system to study adaptive processes of diversification because they are distributed across multiple island chains and exhibit a similar set of habitat specialists (ecomorphs), which are unique to each island group. This study will test the hypothesis that these ecologically similar frog communities evolved independently in each archipelago, resulting in the convergence of entire species communities. This project will document a remarkable case of convergent evolution that could provide additional evidence bearing on the evolution and assembly of biological communities worldwide. Portions of this research will also include advanced undergraduate mentoring in science, including genomic sequence capture data collection and analysis. Additionally, the results of this project will be integrated into a classroom learning module geared toward teaching evolutionary concepts to Kansas high school students.<br/><br/>A major goal of this study is to resolve the evolutionary relationships among Melanesian Forest Frogs of the genus Cornufer using an exon capture sequencing approach. Phylogenomic data will be integrated with morphometric and ecological data from all species throughout the Melanesian archipelagos to test whether (1) frog ecomorph communities evolved in each archipelago through independent adaptive radiations, (2) ecomorphs evolved only once and subsequently dispersed across archipelagos, or (3) a combination of both. Macroevolutionary models will then be used to evaluate whether frog communities in each archipelago are more or less ecomorphologically convergent that expected by chance, which may suggest that adaptive diversification and community assembly has been nonrandom in Melanesian Forest Frogs. This study will promote the development of another rich, multi-faceted model system of adaptive radiation for a variety of conceptual evolutionary studies on the process of biological diversification and community assembly.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1701952","Rafe","Brown","rafe@ku.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kansas Center for Research Inc","LAWRENCE","660457568","7858643441","2385 IRVING HILL RD","United States","Kansas","KS","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Scott","Travers","stravers@ku.edu","02/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their rise pushed several other plant lineages to extinction or severely reduced their diversity. Ferns are the only exception to this pattern. Rather than being marginalized or driven to extinction, ferns actually thrived and diversified in both the forest understory and the newly available canopy. Ferns and lycophytes are unique among land plants in having two independent stages of the life cycle (haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte), both of which had to adapt to the new environmental conditions created by the rise of flowering plants. Many tropical, epiphytic fern gametophytes evolved to produce more leaves than their terrestrial counterparts, which enable them to live longer and to reproduce without producing spores. These are highly beneficial traits in the competitive canopy environment that may actually have enabled ferns to diversify rapidly in these habitats. The increased independence of the gametophyte means that ferns can postpone the production of sporophytes if conditions are unfavorable. As a result, in several epiphytic species we observe a pattern of spatially separated generations, in which the gametophyte can grow in a much broader range of conditions than its sporophyte. Several of these fern species with long-lived gametophytes grow in Hawaii, where ferns remain understudied. This project will investigate the ecology of these ferns in Hawaii, particularly the environmental conditions that favor the evolution of independent gametophyte populations. Temperature, light levels, and precipitation will all be measured in order to understand the ecological dynamics that govern sporophyte and gametophyte production. One graduate student and several undergraduates from the University of Florida and University of Hawaii at Manoa will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods. Results from the study will be broadly disseminated via popular science articles.<br/><br/>This research will survey sporophyte and independent gametophyte floras at five stations in the Koolau and Waianae Mountain ranges of Hawaii at 200, 400, 800, and 1,000 m intervals. At each site, researchers will collect epiphytic sporophytes in 10 X 10 m square plots located off the trail, measure the size of fronds, and preserve tissue for herbarium collections and DNA extraction. Temperature and light levels will be measured using Onset HOBO data loggers, and precipitation will be recorded with standard tipping bucket rain gauges. Environmental conditions will be measured over the course of one year. The results of this study will allow researchers to determine what conditions prevent sporophyte production in ferns, and provide new insights into the diversity and evolution of ferns on the Hawaiian Islands.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1701708","Emily","Sessa","emilysessa@ufl.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jerald","Pinson","jbp4166@ufl.edu","02/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Palms are an interesting group of plants from both an evolutionary and environmental perspective. They have a long evolutionary history stretching back at least 90 million years, evidenced by a rich and widespread fossil record, and are useful indicators of past environmental conditions due to the narrow climatic range within which most can survive. By using the fossil record to inform the evolutionary history of palms, this research seeks to understand their geographical range, and how they have responded to changing environments throughout their history. This research will test current hypotheses on palm evolution, and generate publicly available databases of living and fossil palm diversity. One graduate student will be trained in diverse systematics methods, and datasets generated by this research will also be used to train undergraduates from underrepresented groups. Materials from the research will also be used to develop interactive exhibits for teaching about plant structure, diversity, and evolution to the public.<br/><br/>This project investigates the historical biogeography of the palm family by incorporating empirical data from the geologic record into phylogenetic and model-based biogeographic analyses. It will test current hypotheses of a Laurasian origin of the crown node of Arecaceae and of the biogeographic origins of the major subfamilies. This work will also investigate the role of shifting continental geography in the radiation of palms, and how climatic changes correlate with shifts in dispersal and extinction rates over the last 100 million years. A comprehensive database of the palm fossil record will be compiled and the data incorporated into a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model to infer historical ranges of taxa, and a dispersal-extinction-sampling model to compute dispersal and extinction rates over time, which can be correlated with climate data. Fossil fruits with sufficient characters for inclusion in a phylogenetic analysis will be studied using X-ray micro-computed tomography, and will be used to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny for use in the DEC analysis. Outcomes include a comprehensive fossil record database for palms, 3D morphological data on living palms, a tribe-level chronogram for the family, and new insights into the historical biogeography of this important group of plants.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1701645","Kelly","Matsunaga","matsuke@umich.edu","02/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Selena","Smith","sysmith@umich.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The CLT's main conclusion is that aggregated data follows the so-called Gaussian law, also known as the normal or ""bell"" curve. But scientists in many fields from seismology to computer science to quantitative finance are finding that their data series have long-range correlations, which means that the CLT may or may not be a valid way of looking at how such data aggregates. The PI's work on correlated data sequences, and related questions, would show that the Gaussian-law behavior afforded by the CLT persists up to very long correlation lengths, with some quantitative differences with the standard CLT, such as an increase in how spread out averages tend to get. For instance, one of the PI's theoretical conjectures is that if correlation is long enough, it would take too much data in practice to be able to observe a CLT-type aggregation. The PI will study the effect of even longer-range correlations, showing that instead of bell-curve behavior, data could involve much higher levels of uncertainty (a.k.a. heavy tails), with an extremely slow rate of aggregation. This could be of some significance when applied to financial risk in the housing market: tools could be developed for sellers of institutional mortgage insurance products for highly correlated mortgages; they would help avoid errors in risk calculations, such as those made by the American International Group (AIG) in the years preceding the world financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a taxpayer-funded bailout upwards of $ 180 billion. The PI also plans to study the implications of long-range correlations in so-called spin models which are useful in the physics of random media, where, unlike the example of mortgage-based financial derivatives, long-range correlations and heavy tails could have little or no influence on the average large-scale behavior. The PI's Ph.D. students will take part in both theoretical and applied aspects of the research, working with the PI to prove theorems and test their results in practice using numerics. Involving students in fundamental research with real-world applications will broadly disseminate scientific understanding. The PI systematically encourages students from underrepresented groups to join the research program.<br/><br/> The PI proposes a three-year research program in stochastic analysis, with two groups of topics. First, the complexity of asymptotic laws for variations of Gaussian processes with long-range correlations will be evidenced by searching for conditions implying normal, non-normal, and conditionally normal limits in general situations, including sharp convergence rates. Second, the PI will analyze densities, tails, and convex functionals, spin systems, and hitting probabilities, for general Malliavin-differentiable non-Gaussian processes and fields. A main set of tools is the new use of the Malliavin calculus for quantitative estimates of various distances between laws of random variables on Wiener space. This includes the PI's formula for the density of general random variables on Wiener space, proved with I. Nourdin in 2009. Another tool is the PI's comparison of convex functionals for random vectors and fields on Wiener space, proved in 2013 with I. Nourdin and G. Peccati. Yet another is the first sharp estimates of distances to the normal law on Wiener space, proved in 2012 and 2013 by Bierme, Bonami, Nourdin, and Peccati. The PI will forego power-scale model assumptions such as self-similarity and/or stationarity whenever possible, using instead assumptions which are intrinsic to general covariance structures. One of the consequence of the work will be to show that well-known behaviors in so-called critical cases for power variations can be artefacts of the chosen model classes. Another will be to find out the extend of the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick universality class for spin systems in random media, and to determine behaviors when heavy tails and long-range correlations cause spin systems to exit this class. A third consequence should be to understand the critical cases for hitting probabilities of fractional Brownian motion.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1734183","Frederi","Viens","viens@purdue.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1263","PROBABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","Non-Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Polymer glasses (materials used in applications like automobile headlamp covers and modern composite aircraft) are important in technology because they are stiff, lightweight, and require little energy for manufacture. The response of polymer glasses to external forces (stretching vs. breaking) determines what materials can be used for particular applications but this response currently cannot be predicted. Experiments will be used to measure the rate at which polymer molecular motions occur when a force is applied to the polymer glass; in particular, experiments in which the glass is periodically stressed and unstressed will be utilized. Through comparison with models and computer calculations, these experiments will lead to the development of more reliable predictions of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. Potentially this will have a significant economic impact by allowing broader utilization of these lightweight materials.

This research aims to enhance the fundamental understanding of polymer glass deformation and to test current theoretical approaches and computer simulations; this should lead to the development of more reliable models for the prediction of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. Segmental mobility in poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(lactic acid) glasses will be measured before, during, and after mechanical deformation. Segmental mobility will be measured with an optical photobleaching method that provides access to the rotational correlation function of an ensemble of dilute probe molecules. Enhanced mobility is a key feature of the nonlinear response of polymer glasses to deformation. These experiments will utilize cyclic tensile loading/unloading deformations and more complex deformation protocols. These experiments will discriminate among theoretical models that all qualitatively explain deformation at constant strain rate.

If successful, higher adoption of electrified vehicles is foreseeable in the near future to revolutionize the future transportation systems so that environmental challenges can be addressed for conserving energy and cutting back on carbon emissions and pollution. This research will also have significant impact on other applications such as aircraft electric systems, military portable devices, and aerospace battery applications, where lithium ion batteries are used for energy storage. These impacts will result in economic and social benefit and help the U.S. stay competitive globally. The theory and methodology will be integrated into education through modifications in related courses in order to engage graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project studies the uncertainty management and proactive maintenance of lithium ion batteries in electrified vehicles. The scope of the proposed work is to: i) increase accuracy of a baseline battery model; ii) develop an intelligent uncertainty management system; and iii) facilitate proactive maintenance decisions for lithium ion batteries. The investigators will address four issues including: i) characterization of battery model uncertainty under various battery operating conditions; ii) quantification of various uncertainties and their coupling effects in the battery system; iii) prediction of battery remaining useful life (RUL) under various battery operating conditions; and iv) validation of the proposed approaches on an electrified vehicle. Traditionally, researchers employ electrochemical models to improve battery model accuracy. However, a full order electrochemical model is not feasible for the battery management system (BMS) in electrified vehicles, and a significant level of model simplification must be established to meet the computational efficiency requirement which will cause unwanted model error. The first contribution of the research project will be to study an effective model uncertainty characterization approach to improve model prediction accuracy of a low-fidelity model (i.e., an equivalent circuit model) so that its accuracy is comparable to that of a high fidelity model (i.e., an electrochemical model) but with much higher computational efficiency. The second contribution of the project will be to develop an intelligent uncertainty management system for more effective battery performance estimation so that battery safety can be improved and lifetime risk minimized. Finally, the challenge of battery proactive maintenance stems from the complexity of battery devices. Even the best models cannot predict the complex degradation and failure mechanisms. As a result, accurate prediction of the battery RUL based on the underlying degradation theory is almost impossible. The third contribution of the research will be to study proactive maintenance decisions for batteries through accurate RUL prediction using innovative data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies.","02/06/2017","03/20/2017","1726706","Zhimin","Xi","zxi1@utk.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","7607","ENERGY,POWER,ADAPTIVE SYS","092E","Control systems & applications","7423","Energy collection & storage",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

""Universality"" refers to robustness of certain phenomena and to the counterintuitive prevalence of the same phenomena across a wide array of different physical situations and models. For example, waves in the ocean can organize themselves into ""trains"" transporting energy, and analogous trains are also observed in laser beams propagating in optical fibers; statistical fluctuations in nuclear experiments led to a new type of universality that subsequently has been observed in a wide variety of situations modeled with randomness, as far-flung as the statistics of spacings between parked cars! This research project involves the detailed rigorous analysis of canonical models for a wide variety of physical settings whose singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature. The project aims to develop methods to understand, predict, and control system behavior. The potential long-term impacts of this research program stem from the emergence of universality as a new paradigm in science: probing its range of applicability is fundamental in emerging areas as well as established ones.<br/><br/>This research project concerns the development of new methods for the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems and d-bar problems and application of these techniques to problems in a range of fields including random matrix theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, orthogonal polynomials, and asymptotic combinatorics. In each of these areas, the overarching goal is to provide a complete description of the system (be it the eigenvalues of a random matrix, or the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation). Two examples under study are: (1) Eigenvalue statistics in the normal matrix model. The quest for universal behavior when the eigenvalues are accumulating in a two-dimensional region is in its infancy; this project aims to create connections between rigorous mathematical analysis and physical intuition developed over the last 20 years. (2) The asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the two-cut regime, for which ideas and conjectural formulae have existed for some time.","02/06/2017","02/06/2017","1733967","Kenneth","T-R McLaughlin","kenmcl@rams.colostate.edu","02/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Colorado State University","Fort Collins","805232002","9704916355","601 S Howes St","United States","Colorado","CO","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Joining theory and experimentation, computation is now recognized as the ""third pillar"" of scientific research. More recently, data analytics (the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information) has emerged as an important computational tool for scientific discovery - a tool that is likely to be as important as, if not more important than, modeling and simulation. Within the broad domain of data analytics, the use of graphs is a powerful conceptual tool that describes relationships between discrete objects. Because of the growing importance of data analytics, many research groups have turned their attention to developing new approaches for solving large-scale graph problems. While the research results in this area have been valuable, the software products that have been produced tend to be limited in scope and/or not of sufficient quality to be reused. This project will address this problem by creation of GraphPack, a comprehensive unified graph library with a coherent user interface and support for multiple state-of-the-art compute platforms. This work will have broad impacts in scientific and engineering application areas, larger social and economic areas depending on graph analytics, and in education. GraphPack will improve the ease of use and broaden the applicability of graph algorithms. Application areas include such diverse areas as knowledge discovery, genomics, proteomics, electronic design automation, forest management, Internet routing, power grid management, and many more.<br/><br/>GraphPack will be a reliable and comprehensive toolkit applicable across a wide variety of problems and architectures that will unleash the capabilities of the community by making the current state of the art readily available. GraphPack will develop a consistent and comprehensive set of abstractions necessary to express a wide variety of (generic) graph algorithms and data structures in the context of unimodal as well as hybrid parallelism. These abstractions will be incorporated as abstract concepts, and selected concrete efficient implementations will be provided. While genericity is an important goal, GraphPack will also provide a simplified user interface for graph algorithms for the situations where simplicity is more important than fully tuned performance. GraphPack will also provide a GraphBLAS interface based on the recent efforts to provide a standardized set of graph operations based on the concepts of linear algebra. By providing multiple interfaces with efficient parallel implementations, GraphPack will enable a wide variety of applications to take advantage of high-performance graph algorithms.","02/07/2017","02/07/2017","1716828","Andrew","Lumsdaine","al75@uw.edu","02/07/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","8004","Software Institutes","026Z","NSCI: National Strategic Computing Initi","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)","8004","Software Institutes","8005","Scientific Software Elements","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

PULSE is a national network of current and former department chairs and administrators from a variety of institutional types. The PULSE Fellows seek to catalyze improvement in undergraduate life science education through promoting adoption of the recommendations in the Vision and Change Report (2011). This important report highlights that biology students are more successful when they learn underlying organizing concepts, rather than an accumulation of facts and information; when they develop important skills such as effective communication of ideas, designing experiments and interpreting data; when they learn in classrooms that engage them actively in the process of constructing their own understanding; and when they have the opportunity to participate in high impact practices such as undergraduate research or internships. Despite this wealth of data, most biology departments have not embraced this approach, but progress is being made. PULSE has already worked with over 180 institutions since 2013 and seeks to expand this number significantly over the next few years.<br/><br/>The next PULSE workshop will be held at HHMI Headquarters in Chevy Chase, MD and will include approximately 50 PULSE Fellows, invited experts in institutional change and effective teaching and learning, and several facilitators. The goal of this meeting is to ensure that PULSE's multiple programs are well coordinated for maximum effect and that they will be assessed appropriately to identify interventions most effective in catalyzing improvement in undergraduate education. The PULSE project seeks to promote department-wide change in educational practices. PULSE works with departmental faculty, including departmental leaders, to help them reach consensus about their vision. PULSE is also testing theories of change by assessing the long-term impact of its activities on changes in departmental pedagogies, curriculum, and co-curricular programs. By establishing which types of interventions are most effective at motivating sustained change, the project will enhance understanding of change strategies that advance the goal of better teaching and learning in life sciences and across STEM. PULSE's agenda will be measurably promoted by an in-person meeting of Fellows to coordinate their activities, to plan for transition to a financially self-sustaining organization, and to further integrate newer Fellows into the organization's programs. With the goal of tipping the balance in biology departments toward adoption of best educational practices, PULSE's programs have the potential to accelerate the reform of undergraduate biology education nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.

Chtchelkanova","Ensemble simulations of scientific phenomena typically run for weeks or even months on high-performance computing clusters. The already high level of concurrency of these computing environments is expected to significantly increase in the near future, causing simulations to suffer not only from numerical errors due to limited arithmetic precision but also from the non-determinism in the execution associated with multithreading. Ultimately this trend can compromise the simulation results and break the scientific community's trust in ensemble simulations. This project tackles this problem and defines a methodology to enable the reproducible accuracy of large ensemble simulations on exascale platforms that include multi- and many-core processors. <br/> This project moves along two major fronts. First, the investigators identify common sources of accuracy errors and study their accumulation, propagation, and runtime effects in a controlled environment. This phase includes three research activities: (i) generating code motifs that model those computations that may lead to accuracy errors; (ii) providing multiple implementations of these motifs, called code inspectors, targeting different parallel platforms; and (iii) evaluating the accuracy and runtime of these implementations using a variety of datasets and stress conditions. Second, by installing these code inspectors in real scientific code bases, the investigators study their behavior in uncertain environments. This phase includes two research activities: (i) prioritizing code segments based on quantitative impact scores and matching segments to inspector motifs; and (ii) finding the optimal code inspector implementations and patching the code with them so as to optimize the overall result variance. The applications targeted in this project are deterministic chaotic applications including n-body atomic system simulations and astrophysical simulations.","02/07/2017","02/07/2017","1728850","Michela","Becchi","becchim@missouri.edu","02/07/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7924","MEDIUM PROJECT","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This meeting brings together leading experts in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry to inform the audience of the major developments from the past few years, to advance new research problems and directions, and to establish innovative connections between different subfields. While all of the speakers were chosen for their role in the recent developments, many were also chosen for their communication skills, and their dedication to developing young researchers in mathematics. The organizers expect that all talks will have an important didactic component, aimed at the junior researchers in the audience. The award will be used to support the participation of 40 junior mathematicians (defined as graduate students, postdocs, and researchers within 5 years of their PhD).<br/><br/>The expertise of the speakers covers a broad, but interrelated, range of topics. Nevertheless, explicit algebraic methods and applications of algebraic geometry form a coherent underlying theme. Major themes of the conference include the recent progress on syzygies in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra; rationality and stable rationality of algebraic varieties; and asymptotic stability. These three distinct topics are not disjoint, with many of the speakers and participants working in more than one area. In general, an effort has been made to bring together participants from related, but different, fields, in order to encourage the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques.

Some photo-active bacteria with proper food source and light activation can synthesize high-energy content fuel, such as, hydrogen. In addition, nanoparticles have lot of beneficial uses which range from transparent sunscreens to self-cleaning windows to smarter surfaces. This high risk-high payoff research project integrates nanotechnology, photoactive bacteria, and appropriate light source to convert waste organic acids to highly valuable clean energy. The transformative approach localizes light with enhanced intensity to maximize the production of hydrogen from waste organic acids. This EAGER award, with high impact in energy, environment and global economy involves the integration of photonics, biology, and nanostructured materials for clean fuel production. <br/><br/>The technical aspects of the project involve the combination of photoresponsive bacteria, plasmonic nanoparticles, and selective membranes to produce hydrogen from waste materials. The approach will involve the understanding of hydrogen production from purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) illuminated by light sources matched with bacteria's absorption spectrum. More specifically, it is expected that narrowband illumination of R. Palustris in the near-IR will enhance both hydrogen production and light conversion efficiency. The innovative approach employs nanoparticles with localized surface plasmon resonances immobilized on a polymer membrane surface to enhance the intensity and scattering of light. The research will establish that if the bacteria on top of the nanoparticles are immobilized with a thin dielectric layer in between, it will highly enhance the overall process efficiency. There is clearly a need for a ""high risk-high reward"" approach to dramatically increase light-conversion while maintaining high substrate- conversion efficiency with the goal of combined waste remediation and renewable energy generation.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1700091","Dibakar","Bhattacharyya","db@engr.uky.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kentucky Research Foundation","Lexington","405260001","8592579420","109 Kinkead Hall","United States","Kentucky","KY","1179","Biol & Envir Inter of Nano Mat","7916","EAGER","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

A core focus for this meeting is two important and timely areas of research. The conference will bring together leading experts with young researchers at a time of exciting developments and new breakthroughs. Many of these recent developments were inspired by computer experiments, which are becoming more common within the fields of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The workshop will focus on developing Macaulay2, a leading computer algebra system within these fields. By helping researchers develop their own packages, there will be immediate research impact as they and others compute new examples which push the mathematical frontier. Such examples can answer old questions and inspire new ideas, just like those that are to be presented at the scientific conference. Further information is available at the conference website: https://macaulay2.github.io/Workshop-2017-Berkeley/<br/><br/>The first two days of the meeting will be a conference on free resolutions and commutative algebra. The time is ripe for such a conference; in Summer 2016 Irena Peeva and Jason McCullough (both of whom will speak at the meeting) resolved a famous 38-year-old conjecture on free resolutions due to Eisenbud-Goto. There has also been recent progress on Stillman's question, which asks for a bound on projective dimension of an ideal, based solely on the number of generators and degrees (Mel Hochster and Craig Huneke will give talks on their work). The meeting will then switch gears, to a software development workshop for Macaulay2, one of the world's leading software systems for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Macaulay2 is open source, and one of the key ways in which it extends its functionality is through packages, which allow researchers to write functions that utilize Macaulay2's core functions. The workshop will enhance research infrastructure by constructing packages which will be subsequently integrated into Macaulay2. It will also serve as a training ground for algebraists to use and write for Macaulay2. The workshop will build bridges and foster connections between workers on the theoretical and computational aspects of free resolutions. Macaulay2 workshops have a history of being inclusive both in terms of including underrepresented groups and for including participants from a wide variety of positions. The organizers are committed to continuing this tradition.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1701922","Amelia","Taylor","Amelia.Taylor@ColoradoCollege.edu","02/08/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Adelphi University","Garden City","115304299","5162948700","South Avenue","United States","New York","NY","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sonja","Szekelyhidi","smapes1@nd.edu","02/08/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"David","Swinarski","dswinarski@fordham.edu","02/08/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Branden","Stone","bstone@adelphi.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the mathematical tools currently developed for signal and image analysis (e.g. Fourier & wavelet transforms) were designed to address problems in communications and related disciplines, and many are not necessarily well suited for modern problems related to signal detection and classification. The investigators study new signal analysis and synthesis algorithms (i.e. transforms) derived based on comparing images (signals) using on not only their intensities, but also their respective locations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a framework for signal and image analysis that utilizes a `Lagrangian' point of view. The approach relies heavily on optimal transport and related mathematical techniques. The study includes the development of invertible nonlinear signal transforms, efficient algorithms for their computation, and testing their application in a number of signal modeling and discrimination tasks (cancer detection, characterization of diseased cell phenotypes, visualization of variations in signal databases, recognition from low resolution images, and others). The main emphasis of the study is the development of Lagrangian transforms that have concrete theoretical and practical advantages in signal discrimination tasks.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1707181","Gustavo","Rohde","gustavor@cmu.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Virginia Main Campus","CHARLOTTESVILLE","229044195","4349244270","P.O.

The authors also consider the consequences for those collective efforts for educational inequality. While prior research largely views PTOs as inconsequential based on their small contributions to school finances, more than 90 percent of parents of elementary school children report attending a PTO meeting. The collective action that parents undertake via PTOs often contributes to the definition of school cultures and shapes the distribution of learning opportunities within schools. Since PTO participation rates, as well as access to the financial, organizational, and social capital resources that PTOs generate, vary substantially across racial/ethnic and socio-economic groups; PTOs may simultaneously benefit some students and play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality across and within schools. To make sense of parental collective actions and their consequences, the authors develop three theoretically-informed hypotheses about how PTOs operated in schools: PTOs as generators of resources, PTOs as social capital, and PTOs as mechanisms for opportunity hoarding.<br/><br/>The analyses test these hypotheses by addressing the following research questions: How do parent-teacher organizations affect elementary school practices as well as student behavioral and academic outcomes? To what extent do parent-teacher organizations contribute to educational inequality both between and within schools? To do so, the authors construct an unprecedented data archive describing elementary school parent-teacher organizations. Working with the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics' database of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings for U.S. non-profit organizations, the authors have extract data describing parent-teacher organizations affiliated with U.S. public schools between 2005 and 2012 and link these records with (1) school-level data from the National Center of Education Statistics? nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and (2) student-level data from all North Carolina public elementary schools. This work, coupled with qualitative research designed to validate IRS measures of parents? collective action, will significantly contribute to the field of Sociology as well as educational practice by shedding light on how these organizations form and operate.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1720206","Linda","Renzulli","renzulli@uga.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator","Purdue University","West Lafayette","479072114","7654941055","Young Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","1331","SOCIOLOGY","8050","Science of Broadening Participation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1397",NA,NA,NA,"CROSS-DIRECTORATE ACTIV PROGR",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using mathematical approaches coupled with laboratory experiments, this study will illustrate the basic principles of cellular aging and shed new light on how dietary restriction extends lifespan. Using a novel mathematical model that demonstrates how aging in yeast cells emerges and what genes and their interactions are involved, the close-connection between cellular aging and the robustness of the gene interactions involved will be examined. Given the lack of adequate methods to evaluate changes in genes and their interactions involved in cellular aging, this novel mathematical approach for data analysis could transform what we know about how cells age. Coupled to this research, the educational component of the project will provide cross-disciplinary training to minority students and cultivate their interests in quantitative biology through integrating research with teaching, a student Chapter for the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, tutorial workshops, and broad dissemination of educational materials. Additionally, a new Systems Biology course will contribute to a new Bioinformatics and Systems Biology minor at Spelman College. Research tutorials will be uploaded to YouTube, open research projects will be uploaded to GitHub, and an open research blog will be developed and maintained. In summary, this project will provide training to minority undergraduates in mathematics, computing, and systems biology at a historically black college for women.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project will focus on aging from the perspective of gene networks through an integrated research and teaching approach. Cellular aging will be addressed using the budding yeast, a single-cell organism as a model system. The current knowledge on cellular aging lacks coherence, and a major logical gap exists between molecular pathways of aging and population characteristics of aging. Hundreds of yeast genes are known to influence lifespan, but paradoxically, not a single gene can be claimed as a direct cause of aging. Different and even opposite pathways have been observed when experiments are performed in different ways. Despite the complexity of aging, the lifespan of many species can be extended by dietary restriction. This seemingly complicated picture and the evolutionarily conserved lifespan extension effect of dietary restriction will be addressed by the core idea of the study, that cellular aging is an emergent property of stochastic gene networks. A probabilistic gene network model for cellular aging will be used to illustrate the conserved lifespan extension mechanism of dietary restriction in the model organism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and study how the organization and dynamics of the yeast gene networks will influence the aging process. The first objective is to test a hypothesis that dietary restriction extends lifespan by improving reliability of gene interaction through analyzing lifespan data of hundreds of yeast mutants. The second objective is to further develop the theoretical foundation of the network model for cellular aging.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1720215","Hong","Qin","hong-qin@utc.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Chattanooga","Chattanooga","374032504","4234254431","615 McCallie Avenue","United States","Tennessee","TN","8011","Systems and Synthetic Biology","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The processors and architectures that enable this technology demand a large amount of energy, requiring sizable batteries. The ultimate objective of this CAREER research is to create programmable architectures which require no battery and can rely on energy harvesting techniques. To achieve this objective, we seek to reduce power consumption of the processing units by more than two orders of magnitude. This power reduction is accomplished through novel, transformative methodologies to compose and configure programmable, ultra low power, granular decision-making architectures. New algorithms, tightly coupled with signal processing for power reduction in communication blocks are investigated. Research methods to activate and deactivate sensors with the granular decision making architecture attempts to further reduce the power consumption. The methodologies are validated and refined using two clinical case studies.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of health monitoring practice and medical research, empowering numerous applications that are not currently feasible. Growing demand for health care monitoring applications requires students, engineers and health care professionals to design, develop, deploy and operate wearable systems. This project provides a multidisciplinary platform to realize the educational objectives of developing wearable computers, involving high school students and teachers as well as undergraduate and graduate students.

Elekonich","Studies of complex animal visual displays (e.g., colors, patterns, movements) allow us to uncover how complexity can result from the coevolution of signals and the eyes that perceive them. During courtship, the unusually colorful male Habronattus jumping spiders engage in elaborate dances that showcase movements, colors, and patterns to prospective mates. Although females react to these displays by changing where they face, we know almost nothing about where females look during courtship, or how male displays function to manipulate female gaze. To understand how these displays have evolved to capture and retain female visual attention, this research program will use newly available eye tracking technology and digital tools to examine interactions between male displays and female gaze in the Fiery Haired Jumping Spider, Habronattus pyrrithrix. The research team will then expand their work to 20 additional Habronattus species to understand broader patterns of display evolution. This research program will allow us to better understand how animals communicate through complex visual displays and how evolution shapes complex signals. In addition, the scientific team will use insights from their research to enrich educational collaborations with community partners. These partnerships include the development and implementation of curricula for regional public schools, as well as biomimicry-themed ""superhero summer camps"" and afterschool programming in collaboration with Assemble, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit organization which focuses on teaching inner-city youth about science by integrating art into science education.<br/><br/>One widespread feature of visual systems is distinct regionalization of visual competency across the visual field, including regions of heightened motion sensitivity, spatial acuity and/or color vision. Animals compensate for this regionalization with movements of the head or eyes that aim specialized retinal regions at areas of interest within the visual scene. These gaze movements determine what animals see when they interact with visual stimuli. However, despite the fundamental importance of gaze to animal vision, we know almost nothing about how animals use their gaze to evaluate communicatory displays. We know even less about how visual displays have evolved to effectively capture, retain or manipulate the gaze of signal receivers. This research will build upon current understandings of the coevolution of visual signals and visual systems by evaluating the evolutionary relevance of gaze-display dynamics for diversification of male courtship displays in Habronattus spiders. The research will employ gaze-tracking, video playbacks, and digital and physical manipulations of male displays to reveal basic properties of gaze-display interactions in the species Habronattus pyrrithrix. Leveraging insights derived from these in-depth studies, the research will use comparative approaches to test broader hypotheses regarding the evolution of gaze-display interactions across the genus Habronattus.","02/08/2017","02/08/2017","1734291","Nathan","Morehouse","colorevolution@uc.edu","02/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Cincinnati Main Campus","Cincinnati","452210222","5135564358","University Hall, Suite 530","United States","Ohio","OH","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scheiner","This study uses the rich fossil record of the horse family, combined with information about changing habitats and anatomy in horse evolution, to test the causes and consequences of digit reduction. Domestic horses and their relatives (zebras and donkeys) are large, grazing animals with slender limbs that end in a single digit (the hoof). The evolution of today?s horses is traditionally explained as simple ongoing adaptation to grasslands: as grasslands gradually took over from forests, the early dog-sized, three-toed horses evolved into large, single-toed grazers. Their teeth also became longer to deal with abrasive grass, while their digits reduced so they could run faster or more efficiently across open spaces. However, this textbook explanation is oversimplified and remains largely untested. This study will shed light on a significant evolutionary transition that culminated in one of humans? most culturally and economically important species. Results will be featured in the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH), whose fossil horse exhibit currently shows the oversimplified pattern of evolution. They will also be shared via lectures designed to engage with members of the public, as well as teacher education events at the HMNH that will bring this project into the classroom.<br/><br/>A variety of hypotheses have been proposed for the selective pressures driving digit reduction in the horse lineage: speed for predator escape, economy of movement over open grasslands with scarce resources, and compensation for increasing body size. However, none have been explicitly tested with modern methods. By integrating information on fossil occurrences, trait change, phylogenetic relationships, ecology, and environment, this project aims to directly test potential evolutionary causes of digit reduction in horses. Specifically, this research will use ecological and phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the following questions: 1) Did tridactyl and monodactyl horses overlap in space and time or did they occupy separate niches? 2) Are changes in digit morphology, body mass, tooth height, or habitat correlated across the horse phylogeny? 3) Do changes in digit morphology or environment influence speciation and extinction rates in the fossil record? The results of this project will provide quantitative support (or lack thereof) for the cause of digit reduction in fossil horses, filling in a key gap in our understanding of why this major evolutionary transition happened.","02/09/2017","02/09/2017","1701656","Stephanie E","Pierce","spierce@oeb.harvard.edu","02/09/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brianna","McHorse","bmchorse@fas.harvard.edu","02/09/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Utilizing advanced micro/nanofabrication processes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will be grown inside through-silicon vias (TSVs) and a copper matrix will be added to enhance the density, strength and conductivity of the CNTs. Electrical resistance of individual vias and daisy-chained vias will be measured and an analytical approach will be used to determine the preferred path of current and obtain insights on interface resistance of copper and CNT bundles. Mechanical strength will be investigated through bend tests and thermal expansion of wafers containing TSVs while the electrical resistance of TSVs will be monitored for resistance variation for failure detection. Finite element simulation will be used to verify and calibrate the experiments. Mechanical and thermo-mechanical fatigue durability will be examined. <br/><br/>Interconnects are an essential component of any electronic system. In particular, TSVs are key interconnects necessary for fabrication of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs). Therefore, advancements in the area of interconnects will enhance three dimensional (3D) integration of complex electronic devices. If successful, this research will result in a new material system that is capable of resolving several performance and reliability issues that exist with copper interconnects today, such as high resistivity at very small dimensions and electromigration. The research conducted in this study will lead to new directions taken in the manufacturing and fabrication of micro/nanoelectronic devices and systems by facilitating miniaturization of sub-systems and providing a path for a high-yield, high-volume manufacturing process. Outreach activities include a college workshop for K-12 students, the recruitment of women and minorities into the research program in collaboration with the University of Alabama's LSAMP Program, and participation in an REU Site.","02/09/2017","02/09/2017","1734983","Leila","Ladani","leila.j.ladani@gmail.com","02/09/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Arlington","Arlington","760190145","8172722105","1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT","United States","Texas","TX","1788","NANOMANUFACTURING","084E","NANOMANUFACTURING","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC","9146","MANUFACTURING BASE RESEARCH","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","MANU","MANUFACTURING","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC","116E","RESEARCH EXP FOR UNDERGRADS","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With time, however, bacteria colonize on the surface of the ultrafiltration membranes in a process known as biofouling. Biofouling decreases the transport of purified water across the membrane, requires expensive and time consuming methods to remove the accumulated bacteria, and ultimately, increase the costs, energy consumption of the water purification process, and shortens the lifetime of the membrane. Current strategies to prevent biofouling include use of designer materials that prevent fouling, either via use of new polymers or incorporation of biocides into the existing membrane material. These existing strategies lead to materials that are either expensive, unstable, and/or have decreased performance relative to the precursor membrane. The research will provide evidence that materials chemistry can immobilize a nanomaterial onto a porous antifouling polymer ultrafiltration membrane. <br/><br/>This project explores synthesis of a novel membrane hierarchical structure, which utilizes a hydrophilic polymer to increase the flux of pure water across the membrane by confining the hydrophilic polymer layer to an ultrathin upper layer, without blocking pores. Secondly, sacrificial antifouling strips with biocidal properties will be electronspun onto this layer to localize fouling and antimicrobial properties to certain regions of the membrane. In this one year project, the PI will demonstrate that the antifouling fibers will adhere to the ultrathin hydrophilic layer, to alleviate concerns of the high risk nature of the concept. The first method to be explore for deposition of the fibers is electrospinning, while contingency plans include additive manufacturing and 3D printing.","02/09/2017","02/09/2017","1719747","Jessica","Schiffman","schiffman@ecs.umass.edu","02/09/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Hadley","010359450","4135450698","Research Administration Building","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1417","Process Separations","7916","EAGER","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC","9197","ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their levels can increase dramatically during times of environmental stress such as sun's ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, exposure to toxic chemicals, atmospheric pollutants, and inflammation. The imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and their removal by antioxidants results in a net accumulation of these species in the body, leading to the destruction of the cells and can cause a range of disorders such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, stroke, autism, vitiligo, and depression. Engineered oxide nanoparticles have been shown to possess antioxidant activity and the ability to effectively regulate and scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen species. Despite many successes in the field, new breakthroughs are still needed to develop safer and more effective therapeutic nanoparticles. This research project seeks to establish a new approach toward the design and engineering of nanoparticles with high efficacy for trapping the reactive oxygen species in biological systems. The outcome of this project will allow researchers to further expand the family of nanoparticles used for the prevention and treatment of various types of diseases, and will ultimately impact society's health status and well-being. Besides the immediate impact of this research on the use of nanoparticles for therapeutic applications, the proposed scientific concept has the potential to lead to the discovery of highly responsive and selective nanoparticles for emerging applications such as real time selective biosensors, engineered plant functions for solar energy harvesting, and non-degradable polymeric membranes for low-emission vehicles. <br/><br/>Cerium oxide (ceria) nanoparticles have demonstrated the potential to actively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen species in cell and animal models. The capacity of ceria nanoparticles to scavenge free radicals is strongly related to the exposed particle surfaces and considerably constrained by the limited number of oxygen vacancies on the surface. While the relatively immobile lattice vacancies in the core of particles do not contribute to the observed scavenging capacity of ceria nanoparticles, it may be possible to access these vacancies to regenerate the consumed oxygen vacancies on the surface to enhance the scavenging activity. In this Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project, an unconventional approach, based on the principles of oxygen vacancy migration in the field of solid state ionics, will be applied to explore fundamental relationships between lattice ion mobility and the surface scavenging activity of nanoparticles. The specific objective of the proposed research is to explore the scavenging properties of barium cerate nanoparticles in comparison with ceria nanoparticles in order to compare two compounds with similar transition metal cations (cerium), but with significantly different oxygen-ion mobilities. Utilizing lattice vacancies and continuous regeneration of surface oxygen vacancies to enhance the scavenging activity of nanoparticles is an entirely new concept to advance the field in novel and unexplored ways. A multidisciplinary team will synthesize and characterize oxide nanoparticles, and will evaluate the scavenging activity and redox-induced surface changes of the nanoparticles using spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques.","02/09/2017","02/09/2017","1708057","Thomas","Dziubla","dziubla@engr.uky.edu","02/09/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Kentucky Research Foundation","Lexington","405260001","8592579420","109 Kinkead Hall","United States","Kentucky","KY","1179","Biol & Envir Inter of Nano Mat","7916","EAGER","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mona","Shirpour","mona.shirpour@uky.edu","02/09/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood","It is increasingly likely that predictions of decadal climate change and land use change will yield the accurate information needed to anticipate ecosystem adaptation to human-induced change (e.g. climate variability, land use change). It is therefore essential that we develop new theories, modeling tools, and data products that are capable of predicting ecosystem adaptation to these changes, and that can anticipate how possible nonlinear thresholds will affect ecosystem structure, function, and services. A new theoretical concept is proposed to measure and predict<br/>ecosystem sensitivity and likely adaptation. This award will provide funds to develop complex-systems theoretical approach based on information flow in observed ecological process networks, using data from NEON and existing observational networks, which will be applied to, (1) predict nonlinear transition thresholds in the multiscalar couplings between local and regional ecosystem processes by observing feedback couplings in observed ecosystem process networks, and (2) directly measure the current sensitivity of regional ecosystems in the USA to incremental changes in specific climate variables. Data from existing observational networks (e.g. FLUXNET, LTER, NEON), and the National Phenology Network (NPN) will be used to predict the sensitivity of local and regional ecosystems across the USA to specific types of forcings. This new theoretical approach is able to directly quantify ecosystem sensitivity to changes in forcings, and how nonlinear feedback patterns can help predict possible ecosystem transition thresholds. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed work will create and widely disseminate a set of tools and data products that will allow ecologists across the USA to apply process network theory and information theoretic approaches to analyze ecosystem-scale environmental observatory data. This conceptual approach will be a valuable contribution to the ""data analysis toolbox"" being used by environmental observatories to explain ecological change and its impact on human societies for which these ecosystems represent vital life support. Graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar will be trained in the creation and application of these advanced quantitative methods in ecology and in the synthetic analysis of multi-scalar ecosystem data. The products of the theory-based models will form a critical analytical bridge between raw data collection and the environmental understanding necessary for informed resource management and policy-making in a future driven by historically unprecedented and nonlinear climate change impacts.","02/09/2017","02/09/2017","1734487","Benjamin","Ruddell","benjamin.ruddell@nau.edu","02/09/2017","Principal Investigator","Northern Arizona University","Flagstaff","860110001","9285230886","ARD Building #56, Suite 240","United States","Arizona","AZ","7959","MACROSYSTEM BIOLOGY","7959","MACROSYSTEM BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The materials class, ""pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers"", that are being studied in this proposal are electronic polymers that have the potential to address needs ranging from energy usage, harvesting, and storage. Specifically, the polymers have applications in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), bioelectronics, sensors, and electronic skin. However, for these polymers to be used in a wide range of electronic applications, it is important to understand how the long polymer molecular chains fold in the solid state of the material and how this folding affects its electronic properties. To this end, the PI and her group at the University of Washington will develop, synthesize, and study a new class of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers that can fold at specific locations along a polymer chain, and establish new ways to affect the optoelectronic properties of these polymers. The relevance of the project to a number of applications provides us with an opportunity to communicate the importance of science and engineering to the community. Specifically, an exhibition about polymers will be created in collaboration with the Pacific Science Center (a science museum in Seattle). Additionally, the PI will work with a group known as Diversity in Clean Energy (DICE) at the University of Washington to support women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Within the field of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers, there is a growing realization that defects such as homocoupling and end-groups can adversely affect the properties and thus the performance of these polymers in actual applications. However, what is not clearly understood is why these defects affect the properties in the way that they do. In this proposal, the PI and her group aim to shed light on how point defects can affect microstructure and thus their properties. The research entails the following: (i) synthesizing pi-conjugated semiconducting homopolymers with precisely spaced defects; (ii) assessing how the size of and spacing between defects affect the microstructure of the homopolymers; and (iii) expanding the design rules established in parts (i) and (ii) to alternating copolymers. The research is envisioned to provide means to design the microstructure of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers with an unprecedented level of control instead of relying only on optimization methods as is typically done.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1708317","Christine","Luscombe","luscombe@u.washington.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","1773","POLYMERS","8396","Clean Energy Technology","8607","Solar Energy Capture&Conver",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Melting ice from the last retreat, from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago, raised sea levels by 8 meters or more, but the extents of previous retreats are less well known. The main goal of this project is to understand how Antarctic ice retreats: fast or slow, stepped or steady, and which parts of the ice sheet are most prone to retreat. Antarctica loses ice by two main processes: melting of the underside of floating ice shelves and calving of icebergs. Icebergs themselves are ephemeral, but they carry mineral grains and rock fragments that have been scoured from Antarctic bedrock. As the icebergs drift and melt, this 'iceberg-rafted debris' falls to the sea-bed and is steadily buried in marine sediments to form a record of iceberg activity and ice sheet retreat. The investigators will read this record of iceberg-rafted debris to find when and where Antarctic ice destabilized in the past. This information can help to predict how Antarctic ice will behave in a warming climate. <br/><br/>The study area is the Weddell Sea embayment, in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica. Principal sources of icebergs are the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea embayment, where ice streams drain about a quarter of Antarctic ice. The provenance of the iceberg-rafted debris (IRD), and the icebergs that carried it, will be found by matching the geochemical fingerprint (such as characteristic argon isotope ages) of individual mineral grains in the IRD to that of the corresponding source area. In more detail, the project will: <br/><br/>1. Define the geochemical fingerprints of the source areas of the glacially-eroded material using samples from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea. Existing data indicates that the hinterland of the Weddell embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas, making it possible to apply geochemical provenance techniques to determine the origin of Antarctica icebergs. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till samples to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information identifies which groups of ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents), and the stratigraphy of the cores shows the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using a new method of uranium-series isotope measurements in fine grained material. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/> The behavior of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams is a critical topic for climate change and future sea level rise. The goal of this proposal is to constrain ice sheet response to changing climate in the Weddell Sea during the three most recent glacial terminations, as analogues for potential future warming. The project will also examine possible contributions to Meltwater Pulse 1A, and test the relative stability of the ice streams draining East and West Antarctica. Much of the West Antarctic ice may have melted during the Eemian (130 to 114 Ka), so it may be an analogue for predicting future ice drawdown over the coming centuries. <br/><br/>Geochemical provenance fingerprinting of glacially eroded detritus provides a novel way to reconstruct the location and relative timing of glacial retreat during these terminations in the Weddell Sea embayment. The two major objectives of the project are to: <br/><br/>1. Define the provenance source areas by characterizing Ar, U-Pb, and Nd isotopic signatures, and heavy mineral and Fe-Ti oxide compositions of detrital minerals from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea, using onshore tills and existing sediment cores from the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves. Pilot data demonstrate that detritus originating from the east and west sides of the Weddell Sea embayment can be clearly distinguished, and published data indicates that the hinterland of the embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information will identify which ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents). The stratigraphy of the cores will show the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further time dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using U-series comminution ages.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1724670","Trevor","Williams","trevor@ldeo.columbia.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M University Main Campus","College Station","778454375","9798626777","400 Harvey Mitchell Pkwy South","United States","Texas","TX","5112","ANTARCTIC EARTH SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of this symposium is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral fellows and faculty from New England, in order to engage in research discussions and exchange ideas. This symposium particularly seeks to connect women and other underrepresented minorities in similar fields of mathematics or statistics from universities in the New England area, as well as to promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing these groups. However, the symposium is more broadly inclusive, and hopes to benefit a larger community. The symposium is open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. The symposium will feature two plenary talks, in applied dynamical systems and geometric group theory, three tutorials, including one on public key cryptography, and one in data science, short talks by students (graduate and undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows and faculty, a poster session, and a panel on effective mentoring. A meeting of members of AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics) Student Chapters will also be convened during the symposium. The symposium seeks to have a broad representation from pure, applied and industrial math, and encourages participation from researchers in all areas of mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics.<br/><br/>This pan-New England symposium will serve to build bridges between universities and connect researchers, particularly upcoming and younger researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, in similar mathematical fields. The geographic proximity of these universities makes it more likely that networks formed at the conference can be sustained and strengthened, which in turn should increase the probability that these researchers stay in the field and become highly productive members of the community. The symposium lays a strong emphasis on vertical integration, namely having representation at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, as we believe this is particularly beneficial to achieve the objectives of the symposium.<br/><br/>The symposium website is: http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1727318","Kavita","Ramanan","Kavita_Ramanan@brown.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Brown University","Providence","029129002","4018632777","BOX 1929","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1266","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1267","1263",NA,NA,"TOPOLOGY","PROBABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Steuerwalt","This grant provides travel and lodging support for participants of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance, to be held at the University of Washington's Seattle campus on March 24-25, 2017. The conference has two main objectives. First, by bringing together researchers who work in the areas of financial mathematics and insurance, the conference promotes an exchange of ideas and facilitates new collaborations on topics of recent importance to the global financial system, including systemic risk, security of the financial system, sustainability of pension funding, and broader impact of financial securities. Second, by reserving half of the speaking slots and the majority of financial support for junior researchers and underrepresented minorities, the conference helps develop a generation of investigators to form the future core of the financial workforce in academia, government, and industry. The two-day conference has 18 speakers (six senior tenured faculty, six junior non-tenured faculty, six graduate students) and includes ample time for dissemination and discussion of new findings among conference participants, as well as a panel discussion to address open problems facing the financial community. The conference provides an opportunity for junior financial mathematicians to confer with eminent scholars in the field. The conference website is: http://depts.washington.edu/amath/wcmf/<br/><br/>With the recent financial crises and the continuous introduction of new regulations designed to safeguard the financial system, the landscape of financial markets is changing quickly. These changes have opened up entirely new directions for research within the mathematical finance community. It is the goal of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance to highlight research in these newly developing areas. In particular, a special emphasis is given to asymptotics for parabolic partial differential equations, robust hedging, and stochastic portfolio theory. Cutting-edge developments in asymptotics are required in order to solve challenging nonlinear partial differential equations in various financial applications with market frictions such as trading constraints, transactions costs, and asymmetric borrowing and lending rates. Robust hedging methods are needed in order for market participants to mitigate risk effectively in the face of model uncertainty. New results from stochastic portfolio theory can shed light on market structure and long-term investment choices.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1700717","Soumik","Pal","soumikpal@gmail.com","02/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","1266","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Siu Tang","Leung","timleung@uw.edu","02/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","1263",NA,NA,NA,"PROBABILITY",NA,"Matthew","Lorig","mlorig@uw.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scheiner","This research will investigate the function of genes possibly involved in drought adaptation in wild populations of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Droughts are one of nature?s most devastating forces, affecting millions of people each year. Yet as agents of strong selection on plant populations, they are also valuable for understanding basic evolutionary processes, such as discovering the genes involved in adaptation. Furthermore, studying plant evolution in the context of drought may produce the critical knowledge needed to develop drought tolerant crops. Using a global map of historic drought frequency based on remote sensing data, populations were identified that experience very different drought frequencies. From data on genetic differences among those populations, 20 genes were identified that will be studied for their molecular and phenotypic effects. This work is expected to yield key insight into the evolution of gene function, and to confirm genes underlying drought tolerance traits. The results of studying these genes may be of great value to breeding programs working to improve drought tolerance in crop species. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>Historic drought frequency significantly predicts important drought tolerance traits, flowering time and water use efficiency, among natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will investigate the effects of loss of function alleles on 20 genes involved in flowering time or water use efficiency. A reverse genetics approach based on T-DNA gene knockouts will be used to artificially induce mutations in these genes in a common genomic background. The project will quantify the effect sizes of these hypothesized genes on flowering time and water use efficiency. It will also characterize effects on whole genome expression profiles and abiotic signaling cascades using RNAseq.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1701918","John","McKay","jkmckay@colostate.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Colorado State University","Fort Collins","805232002","9704916355","601 S Howes St","United States","Colorado","CO","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

The meeting brings together principal investigators (PI) of projects awarded by the Smart and Connected Health program from 2011 to 2016. The SCH program was set up in order to bridge gaps in fundamental science necessary to transform health and healthcare, as well as to be focused on prevention and person-centered care. In particular, the Visioning Workshop is designed to address the next generation of challenges in advancing health with foundational research from the computer science, engineering and the social, behavioral and economic disciplines. An objective of the PI Workshop is to provide an opportunity for the principal investigators to explore research progress in a diverse set of funded projects and discuss important current issues, as well as future challenges associated with research in transdisciplinary scientific areas. The discussions will be supported by projects-related posters and further stimulated by cross-talk from the Visioning Workshop. It is anticipated that the meeting will stimulate discussions, connections, and collaborations that will facilitate progress in the area of Smart and Connected Health. <br/><br/>The workshop should have a significant impact on the participants and the future of the Smart and Connected Health program (SCH). The focus of the workshop is on foundational research that supports the growth of smart health within connected communities. The workshop results are likely to include new research directions that will be publicized to the research community through publications and a workshop website. The results dissemination should inform and the developing Smart and Connected Health research community in their transdisciplinary collaboration, educational activities, and spur other innovative research directions. The broader impacts of the workshop are to facilitate progress in the field and stimulate conversations, connections, and collaborations that will lead toward better informed and effective smart and connected health research and resulting technologies for the broadest possible user populations. Additionally, there is a workshop attached to the Principal Investigator meeting that will support the travel for ten students from under-represented STEM disciplines to attend the PI Workshop.

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The addition of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) to a polymer (i.e. a plastic material) can result in hybrid materials with highly improved properties. A classic example is that, while rubber (as e.g. in an eraser) has extremely poor wear resistance, the addition of silica nanoparticles causes the wear resistance to go up so much that a car can drive with tires that last over 50,000 miles. While such property improvements are what drive developments in the field of polymer nanocomposites, the inherent problem is that the nanoparticles are chemically so different from the polymer (a hydrocarbon material) and thus have a strong tendency to separate from each other akin to a water-oil suspension. Thus, the desirable, favorable property improvements that can only be realized by the intimate mixing of the polymer and the NPs become hard to realize on a routine basis. The work here proposes to remedy this problem by chemically grafting polymer chains onto the NPs so that the inorganic particle surface can be ""shielded"" from the polymer, thus allowing miscibility to be obtained. In particular, the work focuses on two strategies for this grafting: either grafting fully formed chains to the surfaces, or growing the chains piece-by-piece from the surface. Which of these strategies allows better control over particle-polymer miscibility and therefore improve properties the most is the focus of this research. In addition to this technical emphasis, the proposed work will also stress the broad, interdisciplinary education of students and the recruitment and retention of women and minority students into STEM programs by attracting high-school and undergraduate students into engineering research activities in the PI's laboratory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is on the self-assembly of polymer-grafted nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix with the goal of impacting the behavior of the resulting hybrid (or composite) material. This physical situation has relevance to improved performance in, for example, rubber tires and epoxies (which are used in electronic packaging and computer chip applications). This underpinning question will be studied through the exploration of three test-beds by judiciously combining theory and experiments. In particular, emphasis will be placed on role of the mechanism by which chains are grafted onto NP surfaces on the final material properties, i.e., whether the chains are preformed and attached to the surface or if the chains are grown link-by-link from the surface. It is expected that the former mechanism will yield a more uniform polymer coverage on the NP surface. The consequence of these differences in surface coverage on the assemblies formed and the resulting properties is the ultimate focus of this work. These research activities are coupled to extensive education and outreach activities. A major focus will be to recruit underrepresented students (both women and minorities) at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. It is planned to grow both the current summer high-school research program, and also the research-experiences-for-undergraduates program during the schoolyear, with the goal of recruiting (and hopefully retaining) women and minorities into STEM efforts.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1709061","Sanat","Kumar","sk2794@columbia.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Columbia University","NEW YORK","100276902","2128546851","2960 Broadway","United States","New York","NY","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>About 70 % of industrial plastics are made of semicrystalline polymers, which have the ability to crystallize when processed industrially. The inherent nature of polymer molecules, consisting of very long molecular chains, leads to a highly complex hierarchy of structures in the solid state. The ability to control these hierarchical structures significantly influences mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting materials. Thus, semicrystalline polymers are used in a wide variety of applications including packaging, textiles, automobile, airplane parts, energy, biocompatible materials, and others. To further improve properties of semicrystalline polymers, it is necessary to understand their detailed structures in the solid state as well as the mechanisms of structural formation at the molecular level. This project focuses on fundamental understanding of molecular-level structures of semicrystalline polymers in samples crystallized in various controlled ways, and may lead to predictions of improved properties for commercially available polymeric materials. The PI will use novel magnetic resonance techniques to probe the molecular trajectory of polymer chains in the solid state of such polymer materials. This information will provide unprecedented detail about the molecular morphology of polymers and the interconnections among crystals, and would have implications on their mechanical properties. This project will also include advanced scientific training of graduate students in technologically important areas. They will experience a wide range of polymer research covering polymer synthesis, crystallization, advanced instrumentation, and molecular dynamics simulations. The research results will be reported in scientific journals and presented by the PI and students at national scientific meetings.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Polymer crystallization induces structural changes of polymer molecules from random coils to folded chains in thin crystals. The mechanism of crystallization has been theoretically and experimentally studied in many publications over the past several decades. However, no decisive conclusion has been reached regarding the crystallization mechanism and chain-level structure. The PI has developed advanced techniques for 13C-13C double quantum (DQ) NMR combined with selective isotopic 13C labeling. Using these together with spin-dynamics simulation enables determination of the re-entrance sites of folded chains, the adjacent re-entry fraction, the successive folding number of semicrystalline polymers in the bulk and in solution-grown single crystals as a function of crystallization temperature. These experiments shed light on the extent of adjacent re-entry of polymer chains in solution-grown and bulk materials, the formation of three-dimensional nanostructures, and the effect of crystallization kinetics on the extent of chain folding. These aspects can be correlated with bundle and aggregation models and recent molecular dynamics simulation results. The planned experiments will further investigate the effects on chain trajectory in crystalline regions for a variety of important parameters including i) molecular weight, ii) polymer concentration, iii) solvent-polymer interactions, iv) confined spaces, v) entanglements, and vi) melt-memory. Such studies will provide detailed crystallization mechanisms of flexible semicrystalline polymers while contributing to the advanced training of students in technologically important areas.","02/10/2017","02/10/2017","1708999","Toshikazu","Miyoshi","miyoshi@uakron.edu","02/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Akron","Akron","443250001","3309727666","302 Buchtel Common","United States","Ohio","OH","1773","POLYMERS","8037","Advanced Manufacturing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The focus of this project is on the coordination of these elements via ubiquitous sensing, communications, computation, and control, with an emphasis on the electric grid. The project integrates ideas from economics and behavioral science into frameworks grounded in control theory and power systems. Our central construct is that of a ?resource cluster,? a collection of distributed resources (ex: solar PV, storage, deferrable loads) that can be coordinated to efficiently and reliably offer services (ex: power delivery) in the face of uncertainty (ex: PV output, consumer behavior). Three topic areas form the core of the project: (a) the theoretical foundations for the ?cluster manager? concept and complementary tools to characterize the capabilities of a resource cluster; (b) centralized resource coordination strategies that span multiple time scales via innovations in stochastic optimal control theory; and (c) decentralized coordination strategies based on cluster manager incentives and built upon foundations of non-cooperative dynamic game theory.<br/><br/>These innovations will improve the operation of infrastructure systems via a cyber-physical-social approach to the problem of resource allocation in complex infrastructures. By transforming the role of humans from passive resource recipients to active participants in the electric power system, the project will facilitate energy security for the nation, and climate change mitigation. The project will also engage K-12 students through lab-visits and lectures; address the undergraduate demand for power systems training through curricular innovations at the intersection of cyber-systems engineering and physical power systems; and equip graduate students with the multi-disciplinary training in power systems, communications, control, optimization and economics to become leaders in innovation.","02/13/2017","02/13/2017","1723856","John","Harris","harris@ece.ufl.edu","02/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7477",NA,NA,NA,"CI-TEAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, current methods to produce coatings are slow, multi-step batch processes. This award supports fundamental research into the development of universal thin film coatings that can be synthesized with nearly limitless functions and applied to a wide variety of surfaces. The research involves the use of brush-like polymeric materials and integration with low-cost techniques for deposition on metal, glass, and plastics. This work has the potential to impact a broad range of commercial processes in semiconductor manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and medical treatment. Graduate students and REU students at both institutions will receive interdisciplinary training that includes polymer synthesis, polymer processing, and surface science. The PIs and their groups are involved with community outreach through the Children's Museum of Houston, and they will design a new module that demonstrates 3D printing of plastic parts with functional surfaces (hydrophobic and hydrophilic). <br/><br/>This research project will establish scalable and universal approaches to prepare functional polymer brush coatings. Current methods to produce brush coatings are slow, multi-step batch processes. The PIs plan to generate functional coatings using bottlebrush polymers, a class of macromolecules that have ""built-in"" brush structures. Bottlebrush polymers can be synthesized with nearly limitless chemistries and functions, and they can be processed into coatings from solution or melt states. Significant anticipated outcomes include: i) Design rules for flow coating thin films of reactive and responsive bottlebrush polymers, which leverages a bio-inspired cross-linking chemistry (dopamine) to ensure film stability and adhesion on any surface; ii) Development of surface-active bottlebrush polymer additives for commodity or advanced plastics, which enables the spontaneous formation of brush-like surfaces during solution deposition (flow coating, electrospinning) or melt extrusion (3D printing).","02/13/2017","02/13/2017","1727517","Gila","Stein","gstein4@utk.edu","02/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","8092","Materials Eng. & Processing","1132","CELLULAR ORGANIZATION","1444","SURFACE ENGINEERING","8021","Materials Engineering","8025","Advanced Materials Processing","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problems in the field. This award supports travel to the conference by students and early career mathematicians from the United States. This conference is part of a series of annual conferences devoted to the area of permutation patterns. Ever since the first conference in 2003, which was hosted by the University of Otago in New Zealand, it has been held every year at different institutions around the world: in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. About 70 participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference websites (the conference website is at https://pp2017.github.io/). <br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science.","02/13/2017","02/13/2017","1703927","Alexander","Burstein","aburstein@howard.edu","02/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Valparaiso University","Valparaiso","463836493","2194645215","1700 Chapel Drive","United States","Indiana","IN","7970","Combinatorics","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lara","Pudwell","lara.pudwell@valpo.edu","02/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Alabama State University (ASU) will conduct research to address the current lack of ideal cell source for the therapy of hepatocyte transplantation (HT), which is considered as an alternative ""bridge"" treatment to liver transplantation until a donor liver becomes available. This project plans to create a new cell culture platform to better control stem cell behavior, leading to a possible solution to the shortage of hepatocytes for hepatocyte transplantation treatment. Non-human (porcine) hepatocytes will be used as a source of liver cells for this study. This project will enhance the academic capabilities and outreach activities at ASU. It will provide new research and educational resources for the newly established bachelor's degree program in Biomedical Engineering (BME). Undergraduate students will be afforded the opportunity to participate in various research projects and obtain training in cutting-edge research.

The investigators plan to recover data that will be destroyed by a planned forest burn scheduled for Spring 2017. Pre and post-colonial period Native Americans actively managed their natural environments through the use of fire to produce grasslands and boost bison populations and this at risk data has the potential to provide critical insights into the natural resource management practices of Native North Americans from the 1600's to the present. A key element of the research is to use the recovered data to map the landscape of the Clear Water Valley in Alberta Canada and to estimate the population numbers of bison supported in the region historically to the present. Understanding the historic ecosystem and the bison populations in the region is a critical part of the decision to reintroduce bison species in the Rocky Mountain region. As a subsistence species utilized by early Native Americans for food, shelter, clothing, and religious practice, bison are a cultural and natural keystone species in the region. As a species hunted to near extinction by the late 1800's, currently, both public and Tribal land managers are considering projects to reintroduce bison into contemporary ecosystems. The researchers argue that after bison and traditional indigenous land management were removed from these ecosystems in the late 1800's the landscape substantially changed, to the point that it may no longer be suitable for bison reintroduction. The project will map, quantify, and provide insights into how Indigenous burning historically created habitats supporting substantial bison populations in the Rocky Mountains near Banff National Park (BNP) in Canada, which can be compared to other regions of the North where cultural burning was also practiced. In addition, the researchers will provide insights into the implications of these landscape transformations and their disappearance for the management of forests, fire, and fauna today. <br/><br/>The region for the RAPID is anticipated to be particularly well suited for study; 1) Banff National Park has a bison reintroduction program and 2) it is a region where Indigenous peoples, such as the Kootenai, historically used cultural burning to create open and nutrient-enriched grassy habitat for bison. Today, these and similar Rocky Mountain valleys are densely forested due to the exclusion of traditional indigenous burning, the introduction of modern fire suppression, and other factors. In order to assess and achieve bison restoration objectives similar to what existed historically, it is vital to quantify landscape condition during the period of traditional indigenous management. Coordination between fire management programs and bison reintroduction groups could benefit the interests of both groups and improve the odds of attaining bison population restoration goals.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate and quantify changes in bison habitat by creating a 3D time-lapse map showing the transformation of the Clearwater Valley in Alberta, Canada from the 1600s to present. The research team will recreate the valley's fire history using modern dendrochronology, cross-dating tree scars left by historical fires. This phase of research will produce a stand age structure reconstruction, a traditional fire scar history using the program FHAES, a climate reconstruction (to determine the degree of anthropogenic vs. climatic influence on the fire regime(s) over time), a comparison of known historical human and bison population events (such as smallpox outbreaks) with fire frequency and tree recruitment shifts, and spatiotemporal GIS maps compiling all of the above. In addition, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will collect 3-dimensional landscape data to measure the valley's modern biotic landscape. A digital time-lapse map will incorporate the tree-ring history to extend the 3D landscape model back in time. Lastly, the investigators will derive estimates of how much biomass burning has changed over the course of the last 300+ years in the Clearwater Valley sample area. <br/><br/>The project's novel fusion of dendrochronology and 3D spatiotemporal GIS expands the realm of what is possible for scientific methodology across disciplinary boundaries. The results of this study will also be applicable across national boundaries by showing not only how much change in the landscape would be necessary for Banff National Park's bison restoration goals, but also demonstrate the need for similar investigations by land managers across North America.","02/13/2017","02/13/2017","1724770","Erana","Loveless","taylor2@email.arizona.edu","02/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Arizona","Tucson","857194824","5206266000","888 N Euclid Ave","United States","Arizona","AZ","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Donald","Falk","dafalk@u.arizona.edu","02/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a typical lithographic process, a silicon wafer is coated with a radiation-sensitive polymer film (""resist"") and exposed to a pattern of light. Radiation triggers a reaction that generates the latent chemical image, and patterns are developed by selectively washing away the exposed (or un-exposed) material. Industrial applications require high-throughput processes, so the resists must be highly sensitive to radiation. This is achieved with a process termed ""chemical amplification"". Chemically-amplified (CA) resists have two principal components: (i) a lipophilic polymer with acid-labile protecting groups; and (ii) a low concentration of photoacid generator (PAG). Exposing the resist to radiation generates a strong acid-counterion catalyst, and heating at moderate temperature promotes the acid-catalyzed decomposition of protecting groups along the polymer backbone. This deprotection reaction changes the polymer polarity for development in an aqueous base. CA systems are highly efficient because each photon absorbed by the resist generates approximately 0.3-2 acids (depending on the photon energy), and each catalyst cleaves hundreds of bonds so a low radiation dose is ""amplified"" through chemistry. However, the excellent sensitivity of CA resists comes at a price, because acid diffusion during reaction will limit the pattern resolution of CA resists. While CA resists have been studied for more than 40 years, there are no quantitative models that predict the spatial extent-of-reaction with nanoscale resolution. This poses an increasingly important roadblock for the semiconductor industry, as current research and development efforts are targeting sub-10 nm feature sizes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The aim of this research program is to identify the fundamental physics and chemistry that produce anomalous catalyst transport and catalyst deactivation. The PI hypothesizes that (i) anomalous catalyst transport is induced by dynamic heterogeneities in the glassy polymer films; and (ii) catalyst loss is a signature of acid-catalyzed side reactions. A series of experiments are planned that will reveal these effects. The knowledge acquired through this research will be developed into a predictive lithography tool that can accelerate materials development and process optimization. The spatial extent-of-reaction in CA resists cannot be directly measured with experiments, so experimental investigation needs to be coupled to models that predict composition at nanometer length scales. The intellectual merit of this research is the development of an efficient, quantitative, and spatially-resolved reaction-diffusion model for CA resists that is applicable in a wide range of processing conditions with parameters determined by experimental investigation. To achieve this goal, the study will employ a minimal set of variables to be determined through optimization while incorporating the underlying physics and chemistry of the glassy polymer matrix and acid catalyst. The framework developed through this research will offer a means to investigate processing conditions and formulations that have yet to be realized in laboratory experimentation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/><br/>The outcomes of this research program may immediately impact materials design and process development for next-generation lithography, as predictive models reduce or eliminate the need for iterative experimentation. After establishing the applicability of the anomalous transport model over a wide range of conditions, detailed descriptions of the method will be available to the general public via publications and presentations, furthering the development of lithography simulation that remains a bottleneck in industrial applications. The students engaged by this program will receive training in polymer physics and chemistry, computational methods, and designing experimental procedures. The PI has a record of engaging high school students and undergraduate students in laboratory research, and also participates in community outreach through NSF-funded K-12 camps at the University of Houston.

A generation ago, law and social science scholars outlined a new paradigm for legal scholarship, focusing on social, economic and political variables in the interpretation and execution of the law. Today, algorithmic processes, data analytics and ubiquitous social and mobile computing pose new opportunities for the study of the effects of law, rules, and social norms. These new opportunities invite the use of new methodological techniques in law and social science research. Yet few law and social science scholars are trained to understand these new computational processes. This is a pilot of a collaborative, multidisciplinary, cross-campus network brought together to plan and train the next generation of law and social science scholars in algorithmic processes, data analytics and the opportunities presented by ubiquitous social and mobile computing. It is for the development of a faculty board, new curriculum, and new training activities to be centered primarily at a Technology, Law and Society Summer Institute. The goal is to develop the updated training necessary to ensure that the next generation of socio-legal scholars are equipped to utilize new methodological techniques and new sites of inquiry. <br/><br/>Just as the consideration of ""law-in-action"" shifted the paradigm for legal research by expanding it beyond the exegesis of law as written and into the domain of what judges, lawyers and citizens actually do with law and how they understand it in practice, the interface between law and computer-based and other computational systems offers the opportunity for a new paradigm shift in socio-legal studies. The proposed series of trainings, workshops and a summer institute will equip law and social science scholars to develop methods for the study of these new legal objects and relationships. During the academic year, participants will test methods and formats for cross-training and collaboration. The broader impacts include training new researchers and helping existing law and social science scholars to re-tool; collaborating with the technology and policy communities to bring law and social science research to bear on their activities; and fostering cross-disciplinary, cross-campus collaborations.","02/14/2017","02/14/2017","1724735","William","Maurer","wmmaurer@uci.edu","02/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","1372","LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES","7916","EAGER","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mona","Lynch","lynchm@uci.edu","02/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research program will educate the next generation of scientists and engineers in the guided design and development of such polymers, within an interdisciplinary research group situated at the interface between chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science. Through combination of advanced polymer synthesis, detailed structural characterization at the nanoscale, and characterization of the resulting polymer properties, this project will reveal new molecular design rules for nonlinear polymers that lead to their spontaneous self-organization at length scales below 15 nanometers. These studies will provide American industry with technological knowledge that enables the development of innovative products that maintain global competitiveness. The educational outreach activities associated with this project will focus on the development of simple, visually attractive demonstrations featuring spontaneous self-organization of macroscopic materials into structures visible to the naked eye. These demonstrations will furnish opportunities for educating and exciting students at the K-12 and college levels, as well as the general public, about advanced technologies based on polymers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Part 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Block polymers self-assemble into a variety of nanostructured morphologies, as a consequence of the molecular frustration induced by coupling two or more immiscible polymer segments into a single macromolecule. A delicate thermodynamic balance governs the lowest degree of polymerization (N) at which an AB diblock polymer microphase separates, which then dictates the smallest microdomain size that can form. One potential block polymer application relies on their periodic microdomains as templates for advanced microelectronics and mesoporous inorganic materials with sub-15 nm features. A common approach to reducing diblock polymer domain sizes is to decrease N, while increasing the chemical incompatibility of the A and B segments. However, applications of these new materials often require costly development of new materials processing protocols. This project investigates the microphase separation behavior of Janus bottlebrush polymers, a nonlinear polymer architecture derived from covalently linking linear AB diblocks through their junctions, as a new means for driving AB diblocks to self-assemble at smaller length scales than their linear homologs. Using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and rheological measurements, the phase behaviors of Janus bottlebrushes will be studied as a function of their compositions, the chemical incompatibility between the homopolymer arms, and the graft density of the bristles along the backbone.","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1708874","Mahesh","Mahanthappa","maheshkm@UMN.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yellen","James Daniels, a graduate student at the University of California San Diego, will examine human adaptations to environmental pressures and the subsequent environmental responses to those adaptations. This co-evolutionary relationship can be investigated via study of the archaeological record in conjunction with study of natural sediment and soil profiles that record changes in past environments. The combined study of human adaptation and human impacts on the environment can provide insight into how environments respond to human activities and whether those responses are beneficial or detrimental to humans. Studying these processes may also provide insight into current and future human impacts and the kinds of human adaptation that produce the most favorable outcomes for both the environment and future generations of humans. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the shift to settled village life on tropical coasts of the New World. Mr. Daniels will investigate the recursive relationship between humans and their environment in this setting by focusing on the archaeological and sedimentary records that accumulated between approximately 5000 and 3000 years ago on the Pacific coast of southern Chiapas, Mexico. This wetland environment lies behind wide barrier beaches and consists of mangrove forests and lagoons within which there is a rich archaeological record of the Archaic and Early Formative periods. The project will unravel how Archaic and Early Formative occupants' manipulation of the environment through land clearance, planting, and other activities affected the stability of the estuary-lagoon system and may have created conditions conducive for the emergence of settled village life. The main hypothesis that will be explored is that increased inland land clearance during the Archaic and initial Early Formative periods contributed to the expansion of the mangrove estuary, thus creating an opportunity for Early Formative people to exploit a new abundance of wetland resources and ultimately to develop more sedentary subsistence strategies. The investigation will combine excavations on small mounds within the mangroves with examination of the history of barrier-beach formation downstream from the mounds. A precise chronology of changes in the two settings will facilitate reconstruction of what the environment was like when it was first colonized by people and how the environment responded to initial and subsequent human impacts.","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1708903","James","Daniels","jtdaniel@ucsd.edu","02/15/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","7606","DDRI Archaeology","1391","ARCHAEOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Geoffrey","Braswell","gbraswel@ucsd.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fraternal twinning rates vary across populations, and this variation and the potential adaptive advantages of having twins are not fully understood. Previous research by these investigators and others suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. This project will collect initial information on the scale and timing of twinning in one population with an extremely high twinning rate, which will provide a foundation for subsequent research projects to understand the cultural, biological, evolutionary, and environmental contexts of multiple births in modern humans. The project also supports international research collaborations and may lead to findings that inform fertility research. <br/><br/>Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning occurs with the release and fertilization of two oocytes. A genetic component to dizygotic twinning has long been recognized, potentially including genes related to follicle cohort size and multiple implantation, but no clear inheritance pattern has been identified. Environmental factors such as smoking may also influence twinning rates. The investigators will collect information on twin occurrence in a village in southern India, to reconstruct when the village started to have twin frequencies that are out of the normal range of other Indian populations, and to begin to explore the potential effects of microevolutionary processes and environmental chemical exposure.","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1720091","Lorena","Madrigal","madrigal@usf.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","University of South Florida","Tampa","336129446","8139742897","3702 Spectrum Blvd.","United States","Florida","FL","1392","Biological Anthropology","1392","Biological Anthropology","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The RAPID project explores the extent to which post-disaster rebuilding efforts are impacted by civic infrastructure, such as sharing practices, solidarity ties, and institutional variation in evaluation methods among non-governmental and governmental organizations. Findings will be disseminated to aid organizations involved in disaster recovery efforts. Reports would offer practitioners and researchers of humanitarian aid/ disaster response a model for a more robust assessment tool that leverages local resilience, particularly the sharing relationships and institutions. The research also fosters international collaboration among scientists, broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and will train undergraduate and graduate students in methods of anthropological data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>Dr. Mark Schuller of Northern Illinois University will explore recovery efforts in Haiti, where Hurricane Matthew caused the largest loss of life and infrastructural damage. The devastation is still being assessed, however the material costs, particularly in the South and Grand'Anse provinces, is quite significant: over 80 percent of structures were severely damaged or destroyed, trees were either felled or stripped of foliage, including staple crops such as breadfruit, and the season's ground crops were also destroyed, along with many irrigation systems. With a team of researchers from the Faculté d'Ethnologie, the State University of Haiti, the PI will developing a sampling frame to identify existing and emergency leaders and agencies, and through a range of ethnographic data collection and analysis tools, explore to what extent sociocultural variables, such as solidarity ties, moral and ethical systems that emphasize values such as sharing, and perspectival diversity among various organizations and entities, are influencing recovery efforts. This research offers a timely, unique, and an urgently-needed opportunity to quickly assess the sociocultural ideologies, belief systems, practices and institutions that are central to the rebuilding effort, offering a clear, early case study with which to evaluate theories of resilience and the relief-to-development continuum, particularly the transition from ""emergency"" phase to ""reconstruction."" Communities' own actions and assessments are often missing from these assessments.

Until recently, such communication has been mostly handled by wireless technologies operating in narrow spectrum bands. However, such technologies fall short of addressing public safety requirements, such as deep situational awareness features that necessitate video streaming capabilities. This research proposes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) along with cellular technologies within a novel and transformative framework that will serve as the pillar of next generation PSC systems. Reaping the benefits of the proposed architecture requires addressing several technical challenges including: 1) potentially damaged network infrastructure, as in the aftermath of an earthquake, causing severe connectivity problems; 2) dynamically varying interference between aerial and ground base stations as well as user equipment, hindering broadband throughput; 3) seamless connectivity problems, in the form of handover failures, exacerbated by dynamic interference and infrastructure mobility. <br/><br/>For addressing these challenges, the proposed research will lay down an interdisciplinary research agenda that combines broadband wireless networks, UAV communications, software defined radios, reinforcement learning, and stochastic geometry, into an integrated and synergistic framework. The project will introduce several innovations that involve self organizing interference and mobility management techniques to achieve ubiquitous broadband connectivity for PSC networks. A comprehensive hardware/software PSC testbed with powerful UAV and radio equipment will be developed to validate, evaluate, and improve the proposed solutions. The theoretical and experimental outcomes will break new ground in PSC systems by enabling real-time wireless multimedia and deep situational awareness capabilities in mission-critical PSC scenarios. Close industrial collaboration will reinforce the proposed testbed, prototyping, and educational efforts, and allow training of undergraduate/graduate students in industrial labs. Outreach activities to local high-schools will attract underrepresented minorities, particularly Hispanics, into STEM areas and the field of wireless networks.","02/15/2017","04/10/2017","1708352","Ismail","Guvenc","iguvenc@ncsu.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7363",NA,NA,NA,"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of the symposium is to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary research in mathematics and physics. The symposium will bring together talented researchers from a diverse range of institutions and backgrounds to address pressing problems at the interface of algebraic/differential geometry, commutative algebra, and string theory. The symposium will consist of one day of invited plenary talks from leading researchers in the field, along with an afternoon of parallel sessions which will invite the contributions of junior and other researchers from around the world. The broader impacts of this event will include the training of graduate students and the increase of interdisciplinary dialog between mathematicians and physicists.<br/><br/>Since its inception in 2002 at the University of Oxford, the annual String Phenomenology conference series has grown immensely and become a focal point for researchers working across a wide range of topics in string theory, particle phenomenology, cosmology and mathematics. It provides a forum to bring together active, young researchers from around the world to address the pressing question - Can string theory provide a model of observable physics? However, any path towards an answer to this question must lead to the cutting edge of modern mathematics. In string compactifications the unanswered questions of physics become those of geometry and lead to novel approaches to questions ranging from invariants of singular spaces to birational correspondences and the classification of algebraic varieties, from Mirror Symmetry to the Geometric Langlands program. A symposium to foster such interdsiciplinary dialog between mathematicians and physicists is timely and important. Topics covered by the symposium will include Differential Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, and Computational methods in Commutative Algebra.

This led to a new subfield that is sometimes called ""the Polynomial Method"". The philosophy behind this subfield is that collections of objects that exhibit an extremal behavior often have hidden algebraic structure. As a simple example, if a finite set of points in the plane contains many pairs that are at a distance of 1 from each other, one might expect this set to have a grid structure. Once the algebraic structure is found, it can be exploited to gain a better understanding of the original problem. To expose the algebraic structure, one defines polynomials on the studied objects and explores their properties by using algebraic tools, often from Algebraic Geometry. For example, for a problem involving a finite set of points in the plane, one might wish to study the properties of a minimum-degree polynomial that vanishes on the point set. Beyond solving various longstanding problems, this new subfield is also leading to the discovery of interesting connections between Combinatorial Geometry and other fields, such as Harmonic Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science. This project is based on the assumption that the new ""algebraic era"" in Combinatorial Geometry has not yet reached its peak. It investigates further problems that seem approachable via algebraic techniques, and aims to further develop the current algebraic tools.<br/><br/>The first part of this project involves studying several main open problems in Discrete Geometry by using algebraic methods. Specifically, studying the distinct distances problem in R^d, the characterization of point sets that determine few distinct distances, and the problem of deriving stronger and more general bounds for incidence problems. Part of the importance of deriving stronger incidence bounds is that many problems can be reduced to incidence problems (including problems from Combinatorics, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory). The second part of the project concerns connections between Discrete Geometry and Additive Combinatorics, also by using polynomial methods. This partly involves further studying known connections between the two fields, but focuses mainly on establishing a new type of connection. This connection consists of defining geometric variants of additive energy and extending some of the known additive energy results to these variants (such as the Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers theorem and higher moment energies).","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1710305","Adam","Sheffer","adamsh@caltech.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","California Institute of Technology","PASADENA","911250600","6263956219","1200 E California Blvd","United States","California","CA","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Differential equations are at the heart of modern mathematics and its applications in other sciences. Model theory is a part of mathematical logic in which objects known as definable sets are studied. The notion of a definable set is flexible, changing as one works in different mathematical settings. In the area of differential algebra, definable sets are closely linked with differential equations, providing a connection between the two subjects. This project plans to exploit that link to advance the knowledge of both fields. The project also seeks applications in other areas of mathematics, primarily number theory.<br/><br/>This research project addresses problems in the model theory of fields with operators. First, the investigator will generalize his work on the differential algebra of the j-function to understand the differential equations satisfied by analytic covering maps associated with various Shimura varieties. This line of work is expected to have number theoretic consequences related to special-point conjectures as it did in the case of modular curves. The project will also investigate several finiteness results in differential algebra; this line of work is expected to have consequences on effective bounds in number theory and in computational differential algebra. The project aims to develop various aspects of the model theory of supersimple and superstable groups as a generalization of recent work in differential algebraic and difference algebraic groups. The project will investigate the classification of disintegrated strongly minimal sets in differentially closed fields. This work seeks to answer a fundamental question about differential equations: what are the possible structures given by the differential algebraic relations between solutions to a fixed differential equation? Finally, this project aims to adapt and generalize results from algebraic foliations and vector fields for application in differential algebraic geometry.","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1700095","James","Freitag","jfreitag@uic.edu","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Chicago","Chicago","606124305","3129962862","809 S MARSHFIELD","United States","Illinois","IL","1268","FOUNDATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Active materials represented by suspensions of synthetic self-propelled particles harvest energy from their environment and alter the properties of the surrounding fluid. They have novel materials properties and promising applications. Here, a new concept of ink for 3D printing, termed ""active ink"", is introduced. Even a small fraction of active self-propelled particles in a fluid results in a dramatic reduction of viscosity, enhancing ink transport through the nozzle and increasing printing speed. This project will facilitate the design and manufacture of new materials, significantly shortening the path from prototype to product. This research will also enable a highly multidisciplinary training and education of students and postdocs who will learn theoretical techniques in applied mathematics and computations, as well as experimental techniques employed in chemistry and nanofabrication. Apart from the development of new 3D printing technology, the work will lead to novel mathematical models and efficient computational algorithms.<br/><br/>A drastic reduction of effective viscosity and increase of self-diffusivity of the active ink due to the presence of synthetic self-propelled particles will be studied. The reduction of the effective viscosity will enhance ink transport through the nozzle. The increase of the effective self-diffusivity will enable faster polymerization resulting in resolution enhancement and more accurate 3D feature design. In addition, due to their fundamentally different response to applied shear flow, the use of active particles may lead to the design of composite materials with novel distributions of particles. The functionalization of active particles also will allow tuning the properties of the hardened polymer. New mathematical models will be developed and analyzed both numerically and analytically. Their predictions will be experimentally verified. The continuum partial differential equation model based on kinetic theory will be analyzed asymptotically and numerically. A key challenge here is to find stationary flow solutions by employing methods from fixed-point and topological degree theory. In simulations of particle-based models, the challenge is to accurately capture the dynamics of the reaction that occurs as the active rods move. A difficulty in simulations of the continuum model is incorporating the molecular-scale reactions into a mesoscale approach. By addressing these challenges, the utility and applicability of these computational methods will be significantly expanded, allowing them to be used for simulating a broad range of multi-component, dynamical systems.","02/15/2017","02/15/2017","1735700","Igor","Aronson","aronson@anl.gov","02/15/2017","Principal Investigator","Pennsylvania State Univ University Park","UNIVERSITY PARK","168027000","8148651372","110 Technology Center Building","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","8292","DMREF","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","8400","DMREF","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this conference is twofold. First, it will set up a platform where new collaborative research projects can be started, current ones can be furthered, and completed ones can be reported on. Second, the meeting will take advantage of the Midwest's outstanding tradition in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and contribute to this tradition by giving young mathematicians an opportunity to meet the leaders in the field and absorb the latest trends and techniques. Through a poster session, this meeting will help, in particular, with the transition from graduate student to academic employee.

Recent discoveries have occurred that touch finiteness properties, the cohomology of Milnor fibers, the homological conjectures, and birational geometry. This meeting will take advantage of these new developments and infuse them into the current generation of graduate students.

MAAGC is an annual conference series held in Philadelphia which brings together senior researchers and junior mathematicians to promote collaborations and regional interactions, while highlighting recent significant developments in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. Each MAAGC workshop has brought four outstanding mathematicians from across North America to give talks about new advances in algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other related fields. In addition to these invited lectures, there is a poster session for junior participants, a panel discussion featuring concrete and timely professional advice for mathematicians at varying stages in their careers, and plenty of unstructured time for forging mathematical collaborations.<br/><br/>MAAGC workshops are designed to strengthen and connect the scientific communities in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics by facilitating positive interactions among students, postdocs, and faculty at research universities as well as small colleges in the Mid-Atlantic. We aim to include even more graduate student and postdoctoral participants throughout the region, providing early career researchers the opportunity to learn about recent trends in the field, disseminate their own work, build professional connections, and advance new mathematical results. The majority of the budget is thus dedicated toward funding students and young researchers without other means of financial support, prioritizing participants who also present posters.

Scheiner","This project will investigate the genetic and cellular processes that allow some populations of the American green tree frog (Hyla cinerea) to tolerate high salt concentrations, and how saltwater affects the natural history of amphibians. The ongoing decline of habitat quality and quantity has increased the urgency to understand how organisms adapt to new or changing environments. Evolution might occur rapidly and quickly enough to rescue populations and protect species from being lost in the face of a changing environment, including by the increasing salinization of freshwater wetlands around the world. As wetlands grow saltier, many freshwater wetland organisms such as fish, turtles, and frogs may become locally extinct. However, populations of the American green tree frog have been discovered in brackish wetlands. This project will compare frogs from coastal and inland populations for differences in gene expression, egg hatching, and larval development, among other traits. The results will lead to a much better understanding of the process of adaptation to saline environments. In addition, the project will engage with K-12 students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>To determine whether putatively salt-tolerant frog populations are adaptively diverging from freshwater populations in response to salt exposure, this study uses a common garden, factorial design to investigate endpoints across multiple levels of biological organization across three stages of anuran amphibian development (egg, larval, and post metamorphosis). The study will characterize transcriptomic responses following saltwater exposure and relate these patterns to subsequent protein expression and fitness correlates (e.g., developmental rates, survival). In doing so, the project links selective pressures occurring at the level of the whole organism to the molecular processes that underlie adaptation. The project will identify the mechanisms that underlie salt tolerance and differentiate between competing hypotheses about the role of genetic variation and plasticity in the evolution of adaptive change.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1701690","Michael","McCoy","mccoym@ecu.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","East Carolina University","Greenville","278584353","2523289540","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","North Carolina","NC","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Molly","Albecker","albeckerm09@students.ecu.edu","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One process involved in species formation is known as ecological speciation, which occurs when different environments promote genetic diversification in a geographically widespread species. It is particularly useful to investigate and model this process in organisms that naturally disperse widely, such as bats. This project will explore differences within and among closely related species of the western long-eared Myotis bats. A novel aspect of this work will be the development of an analytical framework that tests for correlations between phenotypes and genotypes while controlling for environmental variation. This analytical pipeline will be made publicly available, and may be used to test the predictions of ecological speciation in a variety of different organisms. Results from this work will also have important practical implications to bat conservation efforts. To communicate findings from this research to a broader audience, an online interactive museum focused on the tempo and mode of speciation of Myotis bats will be developed. <br/><br/>This research will identify phenotypic evidence of ecological speciation in western long-eared Myotis bats of North America by co-analyzing genomic, morphological, and environmental data. Previous findings demonstrate that these species follow a pattern of speciation-with-gene-flow that might have been promoted by environmental changes. Therefore the hypothesis that morphological differentiation among these bat species is associated with both divergence-with-gene-flow patterns and environmental variation will be tested. Specifically, craniodental shape and size variation among these species across different environments will be examined, using geometric morphometric approaches. A novel approach that accounts for both genetic and environmental covariation on morphometric differences within and among species will be developed. This framework will use geometric morphometrics coupled with environmental niche and genomic scan analyses to identify outlier loci that may have evolved under divergent selection. Finally, this new framework will be applied to predict morphometric variation among the western long-eared bats and differentiate between phenotypic convergence and gene flow among species. This integrative approach will allow us to understand the tempo and mode of speciation of Myotis bats from a phenotypic, genetic and environmental perspective.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1701810","Bryan","Carstens","carstens.12@osu.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","Ohio State University","Columbus","432101016","6146888735","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Ohio","OH","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ariadna","Morales","ariadna.biologia@gmail.com","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scheiner","This research tests the hypothesis that individuals with inefficient energy metabolism will have a decreased ability to fight infection, which in turn will decrease their future reproductive ability. Fighting infection requires individuals to invest energy in immune responses. These responses can deplete energy supplies that would otherwise be used for growth, maintenance, and reproduction, particularly when energy is limited. Individual organisms may be energy limited when nutrients are not available or when their genes do not allow efficient processing of nutrients into energy supplies. The research will also address questions about how fighting infection changes metabolic rate. By using the model genetic organism, Drosophila melanogaster, which has natural immune responses that are similar to humans, this project will generate critical information on how genetic variation in energy metabolism affects the ability of human cells to fight infection. This research will also be used to design new exercises for introductory biology laboratories that will help students synthesize information across diverse topics covered in introductory biology courses, from evolution to immunity and physiology.<br/><br/>This project tests the prediction that the energy required to activate the immune system during development decreases the ability of individuals with inefficient energy metabolism to fight infection, and creating a resulting decrease in future adult reproduction. The project connects the effects of interactions between innate immunity and energy metabolism pathways at the organismal, molecular, and physiological levels in a well-studied genetic system. The experiments take advantage of a well-characterized set of genotypes, one of which has a disrupted mitochondrial-nuclear interaction that results in inefficient energy metabolism. Objective 1 will quantify whether flies with inefficient energy metabolism have lower infection survival and greater deleterious consequences for reproductive fitness after infection by a natural pathogen, Providencia rettgeri. Experiments will also modify the nutrient diet to further decrease the energy available for immune responses in all genotypes. Objective 2 will measure the activation of underlying molecular pathways and aspects of cellular energy metabolism to explain effects on tradeoffs between immunity and reproduction. Experiments include quantifying levels of antimicrobial peptide induction, measuring the amounts of key proteins in energy-sensing pathways, assessing the bacterial load during infection, and monitoring indicators of the cellular energetic state and organismal metabolic rate during infection.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1701876","Kristi","Montooth","kmontooth2@unl.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Lincoln","685031435","4024723171","151 Prem S.

This research seeks to estimate the evolutionary history of freshwater mussels to examine species limits and geographical history of the group. The project will train one graduate student and two undergraduates in diverse systematics methods. Data from the project will be disseminated broadly via the MUSSEL Project database.

Scheiner","This project will investigate how differences in natural selection on males and females effects the genetic basis of scent differences in the moss, Ceratodon purpureus. In many plants and animals, males and females exhibit many differences in form and physiology. These differences are thought to arise because qualities that are beneficial in one sex may be deleterious in the opposite sex. Although physical differences between males and females are very conspicuous, we have a poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms that generate these differences, and many of their benefits. In Ceratodon, female mosses produce scents to attract small insects that carry sperm from male plants, promoting reproduction, while male plants make few such scents. This research will test the idea that the production of these scents is costly in males, and that the genes for scent production are present but turned off in males. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>The project will use quantitative genetics and transcriptomic experiments to understand the evolutionary forces shaping sexually dimorphic scent profiles. Scents are comprised of a cocktail of volatile organic compunds (VOC). Measures of VOC production in a pedigreed population is providing an estimate of the additive genetic variance and covariance for VOC production in males and females. Competitive mating trials will be used to evaluate the fitness consequences of variation in VOC production in males and females, both in the presence and absence of sperm-dispersing arthropods. RNAseq analyses in high and low VOC producing males and females will be used in conjunction with existing biochemical pathway databases to identify transcripts linked to VOC production.

This question remains unresolved because species accumulate over deep timescales, and previous studies have revealed ambiguous results. In contrast to studies across species, studies across populations show clear links between mate selection and rapid evolution, and show correlations between male mating signals and the associated female preferences. Missing in the literature is a study that tests these population-level findings in a species-level context, specifically, one that correlates differentiation in male mating signals and female perception. If changes in female perception are met with changes in male signal, the project will support a novel finding: that similar mechanisms are at work across species as across populations. This also suggests that sexual signals may be constrained by female physiology, and that changes in female physiology allow for changes in male signal diversity. Results from this project will be disseminated at international meetings, undergraduates will be actively involved in this research, and outcomes of this project will contribute to the development of novel biomedical reporter enzymes that create different colors of bioluminescence. <br/><br/><br/>Bioluminescent, mate-signaling ostracod crustaceans offer a unique system to understand how closely sexual signals associate with their intended receivers. The researchers will first measure bioluminescent emission spectra from males of 26 species of ostracod crustaceans collected from the Caribbean Sea. Next, they will measure female perceptual spectra from 10 species using a visual physiology technique that determines the absorption of specific wavelengths of light through single photoreceptor cells in the eye. The researchers will then determine the amount of overlap of male sexual trait spectra (the color of the bioluminescence) and the female perceptual spectra. If population genetic theory holds, and preference is determined by perception, we expect covariation between male signals and female physiology.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1702011","Todd","Oakley","oakley@lifesci.ucsb.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Santa Barbara","Santa Barbara","931062050","8058934188","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emily","Ellis","emily.ellis@lifesci.ucsb.edu","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are severely threatened due to their importance in the cement industry. This is especially notable in Southeast Asia where extensive tracts of karst outcrops are being quarried to the ground, resulting in the inevitable extinction of numerous species of plants and animals. Consequently, conservation efforts have been geared towards the discovery and description of new species to highlight the importance of this ecosystem as imperiled arks of biodiversity. However, relatively little research has focused on understanding the mechanisms that have generated this biodiversity. This project aims to elucidate the genetic mechanisms responsible for the evolution of karst-adapted organisms by investigating how genes interact with the environment to drive the formation of new species. Results from this study will not only aid in informing conservation measures in threatened karst habitats worldwide, but will also contribute towards the understanding of how species adapt to an ever changing environment.<br/><br/>Bent-toed Geckos of the genus Cyrtodactylus exhibit a wide array of specialized ecotypes that are associated with different habitats. Among these, karst-adapted species have evolved independently six times in three distantly related clades in Malaysia, indicating that the diversification of karst lineages may be ecologically driven (ecological speciation). The replicated evolution of karst adaptation in Bent-toed Geckos represents a unique and compelling natural system to determine whether geckos transitioning to karsts are subjected to ecologically-based divergent selection that ultimately leads to speciation. Because karst ecosystems are characterized by unique geomorphological features and physiochemical conditions that set them apart from non-calcareous environments, divergent selection is expected to act on independently evolving karst lineages that occur in separate but similar karst environments. This study will use genome-wide SNP data obtained using a double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq) protocol due to the availability of large numbers of independent loci across the genome, which enable the detection of departure from neutrality and signatures of selection. A hybridization capture using RAD probes method (hyRAD) will then be used to obtain comparable and orthologous loci among more distantly related groups. Signatures of ecologically-based divergent selection can then be detected by identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables using a latent factor mixed model (LFMM) method. Additionally, karst and non-karst lineages are expected to be in different stages of reproductive isolation, with older lineages showing less (or a complete lack of) gene flow among populations compared to lineages that have diverged more recently, in which gene flow may be common.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1702036","Rafe","Brown","rafe@ku.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kansas Center for Research Inc","LAWRENCE","660457568","7858643441","2385 IRVING HILL RD","United States","Kansas","KS","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kin Onn","Chan","chanko@ku.edu","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Genome size is a measurement of the amount of DNA found inside the nucleus of a single cell. A puzzling question about genome size is why it varies so much in different organisms. The largest animal genome is over 3,000 times bigger than the smallest. Understanding the cause of these differences can provide important insights into the evolutionary processes and history that shaped organisms, since differences in genome size may be caused by organisms gaining or loosing genes or other parts of the genome. Genome size is also important to consider when planning DNA sequencing projects, as larger genomes require more resources than small ones. An important barrier to understanding the patterns that cause genome size variation is how few measurements there are. Currently, genome size estimates exist for only 0.4% of animal species. This number is so small due to how difficult it is to get a reliable estimate. Traditional methods rely on specially prepared cells from living organisms. However, live specimens can be difficult or impossible to obtain for species that are rare, endangered, or extinct. Fortunately, there are new methods to estimate genome size using DNA sequencing that do not require living tissue. This project will examine the reliability of DNA sequence-based genome size estimates on both live beetles and old, preserved specimens from museum collections. No previous experiments have specifically compared these methods or tested their reliability in old specimens. This project will also contribute additional data points for the broader study of genome sizes across the tree of life, and will further the use of museum collections in the study of the world's diversity. <br/><br/>Next generation sequencing (NGS) has given researchers a new set of tools for estimating genome size. This project will investigate the viability of NGS coverage-based methods for determining genome size in carabid beetles by performing flow cytometry and shallow Illumina sequencing on ten species of carabid beetle. It will also determine if genome size estimation by coverage analysis can be reliably employed on preserved material from museum collections by repeating shallow Illumina sequencing on old museum specimens of the same ten species. A total of 36 genomic libraries will be prepared and sequenced across four Illumina lanes. Coverage-based analyses will be performed on all resulting sequences, and the resulting genome size estimates will then be compared with those obtained by flow cytometry using a one-way ANOVA test to determine if coverage-based estimation is a viable alternative for both fresh and museum specimens.

Due to the rich social organization of bees, the overall performance and health of a bee colony depends both on a successful division of labor among the bees and on adequate reaction to the environment, which involves complex behavioral patterns and biological mechanisms. Much remains to be discovered on these matters as research is currently limited by our ability to effectively collect and analyze individual's behavior at large scale, out of the laboratory. The technology developed in this project will enable biologists to study the individual behavior of thousands of bees over extended periods of time. It builds on innovative algorithms and software to analyze big data collected from colonies in the field. Study of behavioral patterns at such scale will provide unique information to advance knowledge on biological processes such as circadian rhythms that influence bee behavior in addition to playing an important role in animals and humans. The models developed will help better understand factors involved in colony collapse disorder, thus guiding future research on threats to such an important pollinator. This work will be performed through the tight collaboration of a multi-disciplinary team of researchers to combine the latest advances in computer science and data science with expertise in biology. It will provide the opportunity to train students from underrepresented minority on research at the intersection of these fields and to reach more than 600 undergraduate students, high school students, and the general public about how the Big Data approach can contribute to current scientific and ecological challenges.<br/><br/>The project will develop a platform for the high-throughput analysis of individual insect behaviors and gain new insights into the role of individual variations of behavior on bee colony performance. Joint video and sensor data acquisition will monitor marked individuals at multiple colonies over large continuous periods, generating the first datasets of bee activities of this kind on such a scale. Algorithms and software will be developed to take advantage of a High Performance Computing facility to perform the analysis of these massive datasets. Semi-supervised machine learning will leverage the large amount of data available to facilitate the creation of new detectors for parameters such as pollen carrying bees or fanning behavior, currently annotated manually. Predictive models and functional data analysis methods will be developed to find patterns in individual behavior based on multiple parameters and over large temporal scales. These advances are expected to help uncover mechanisms of individual variations previously unobservable. They will enable the first large scale biological study on the circadian rhythms of the bee based on the variations in behavior of individuals in multiple activities instead of reasoning on single activities or averages. Progress, datasets and software will be shared with the community on the project website (sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/bigdbee).","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1707355","Remi","Megret","remi.megret@upr.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras","San Juan","009311790","7877634949","PO Box 21790","United States","Puerto Rico","PR","1165","ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)","8083","Big Data Science &Engineering","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8083","9150",NA,NA,"Big Data Science &Engineering","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Electrically charged polymers, called polyelectrolytes, are common in biology and include DNA, RNA, proteins, and mucous layers. They are increasingly used for applications ranging from drug delivery to membranes for sensing or batteries. Membranes of polyelectrolytes for these applications can be built up, layer by layer, by sequentially dipping a surface into a negatively charged polyelectrolyte followed by dipping into a positively charged one. Additionally, gels swollen with water, known as ""coacervates"", can be made by mixing two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Despite the importance of these materials in biology and advanced applications, their behavior is poorly known, and neither the properties of coacervates nor the rate of growth of layer-by-layer membranes is understood at present. While promising theories for such polyelectrolyte materials have recently been developed, there is little systematic experimental data to test and confirm these theories so as to help design advanced materials. To provide such tests, this project will use both simple and advanced experimental methods to measure the composition of coacervates, and the growth rate and thickness of layer-by-layer films. These measurements will be carried out systematically with varying salt concentration and pH to establish quantitative trends needed to test and confirm newly developed theory and provide a firm base for design of advanced materials made from polyelectrolytes. Such knowledge is also relevant in biological systems, including the interactions of positively charged proteins with negatively charged DNA, which controls the structure and function of chromosomes. Beyond the research, broader impacts of this project will include the education of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach, and development of specialized computational codes relevant to this topic.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>To understand and test theories for the equilibrium and dynamics of assemblies of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, several phases of study will be performed. First, the phase behavior including compositions of individual polyions in both coacervate and supernatant phases for four common polyelectrolyte mixtures will be measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, proton NMR, and other methods. The results will be compared to the predictions of new theories, and used to test and improve these theories. Titrations with acid and base will be used to determine ion pairing equilibrium constants, ionization equilibrium, and thermodynamic ""chi"" parameters. In addition, Layer-by-Layer (LbL) growth rates for these polyelectrolytes will be measured and the thermodynamic information determined by theory and phase behavior will be used to predict these growth rates. The diffusivities of polyions through the polyelectrolyte multilayer needed for predictions of LbL growth will be inferred from strengths of ion pairing obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a polyanion and polycation in water and salt.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1707640","Ronald","Larson","rlarson@umich.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In studies of contemporary agriculture, researchers strive to understand how people choose livelihood strategies and to infer the long-term implications of their decisions for regional political stability, economic security, and landscape sustainability. Archaeological research is well-positioned to contribute to knowledge about the impact rural farmers can have in these realms due to its focus on behavioral and environmental changes over extended time frames. Within this broader context, this project will generate an agricultural history for the research site, including an account of the activities pursued and crops grown through time, focusing on periods of high population density. The study will provide training to graduate-level students from the United States as well as undergraduate students from Mexico. It will generate collaborations between laboratory scientists in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Research results will be disseminated through publications written for broad audiences in more than one language and the installation of an exhibit in the museum of the community that will host the research. Community residents will be made aware of food production strategies employed in the past that could prove useful for them today.<br/><br/>Archaeological research has focused on large political centers, while extant historical records primarily tell the stories of elites. Recent studies have begun to address daily lives and household economies. This project shifts attention to farmers and their strategies given regional constraints and opportunities. It will study whether past peoples living in the rural community of Tahcabo diversified their economic activities or pursued specialized production of particular goods or crops during times of population growth spanning the Early Classic (AD 200-500), Late Classic (AD 600-900), and Colonial (AD 1550-1800) periods. Excavations will take place in houses and gardens from these time periods in order to locate evidence for the economic activities conducted by household. Analysis of soil samples for microscopic plant remains will provide information on the crops grown through time. Chronological information about the occupation of each house will be determined through the study of ceramic styles and the dating of charred wood. Using these lines of evidence, the project will test propositions about the strategies employed by farmers before and after Spanish colonization. The results will provide new insights into the relationship between social and agricultural change.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1709483","Maia","Dedrick","mdedrick@live.unc.edu","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","CHAPEL HILL","275991350","9199663411","104 AIRPORT DR STE 2200","United States","North Carolina","NC","7606","DDRI Archaeology","1391","ARCHAEOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patricia","McAnany","mcanany@email.unc.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In coming years, the frequency and intensity of coastal flooding are anticipated to increase because of rising sea levels and amplified storm severity. While there have been numerous studies of decision-making around temporary evacuation, surprisingly little is known about how people decide whether and when to leave permanently. Ephemeral data collect by this project will be used to understand the factors that affect how people make migration decisions. Findings from this research will be of use to city and regional planners and local and state governments as they prepare for the outcomes of future disasters. Therefore, a University of Georgia team composed of architect Brian Orland and anthropologist Meredith Welch-Devine will take advantage of the recent occurrence of Hurricane Mathew to learn more about how extreme events affect relocation intentions.<br/><br/>The researchers will focus their investigation on the Georgia coast. Hurricane Matthew's impact on the Georgia coastline offers an unusual opportunity to investigate how residents experienced the storm and how that experience affected thinking about future migration. The storm passed the Georgia coast at low-tide so the resulting surge was particularly revealing of where the future impacts of projected sea level rise and future storms would likely occur. Residents now understand who will be impacted and how severely by future storm events. Because most residents eventually were able to return their homes, they comprise an ideal population from which to collect baseline data for longitudinal research. The researchers will survey coastal residents about their beliefs and attitudes toward climate change, sea-level rise, storm events, and emergency preparedness. The survey data will be complemented by in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of residents stratified by social and economic status. The data will also be used as a baseline for future post-storm research in the area, as well as by social scientists seeking to improve theories of what factors most affect people's relocation choices after extreme events.","02/16/2017","02/16/2017","1719532","Meredith","Welch-Devine","mwdevine@uga.edu","02/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","ATHENS","306021589","7065425939","310 East Campus Rd","United States","Georgia","GA","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","1390","CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY","7914","RAPID","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","9278","HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL CHANGE","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,"Brian","Orland","borland@uga.edu","02/16/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is often thought that the genes underlying convergent evolution within species are similar, but this is still an open question. This proposal uses a nucleic acid sequencing method to which genes are turned on or off at any time. This information is then compared with tail color patterns of guppies. Tail coloration is highly variable trait and plays a key role in mating displays. The project will identify color genes in different fish at different locations to understand if the same genetic signatures result in similar patterns. The study will advance scientific knowledge by answering questions concerning the predictability of evolution, and will provide research opportunities for undergraduates at one of the most ethnically diverse universities in the nation. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on convergent evolution. Specifically, the researchers address two questions: 1) How similar are visible color patterns among individuals from genetically diverged populations? and 2) Will genes differentiating extreme color patterns within a population be convergent among individuals from genetically diverged sites, and if so, which ones? For the first question, the researchers will analyze photographs of male guppies from five sites and sort the patterns into color categories. The researchers hypothesize that there will be convergence in the color patterns of males from genetically diverged populations. The second question will be answered using next generation DNA sequencing. For each of the five sites, tissues from males with colored and uncolored tails will be sequenced. The differentially expressed genes between tail color types at one site will be compared to the differentially expressed genes between tail color types at the other sites to test for convergence.

Chemical defense strategies (various types and concentrations of mustard oils) are highly variable across natural populations of the study species. These defensive compounds have known ecological effects, both as deterrents of insect feeding on leaves (above-ground effects) and as drivers of microbial community composition in the soil (below-ground effects). The researchers will test how plant growth and reproduction are influenced by the above- and below-ground effects of different chemical defense strategies on plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions. The project provides opportunity for undergraduate training. Planned outreach activities will target middle and high school students, and also the general public during the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival.<br/><br/>The pleiotropic effects of plant defensive chemicals and the genes that underlie them are well documented. In addition to influencing fitness by mediating herbivory in aboveground environments, defensive chemicals can affect microbial communities in the soil immediately surrounding root tissue. It is likely that interactions between above- and belowground selective pressures influence overall patterns of natural selection on plant chemistry. The investigators will test for pleiotropic above- and belowground effects of a chemical defense gene utilizing near-isogenic lines of the ecological model species, Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), that vary in a gene controlling mustard oil biosynthesis to. They will first characterize the effects of defensive chemical profiles on microbial community assembly in the rhizosphere. Second, they will assess how rhizosphere selection affects plant fitness. Finally, they will test how the belowground context may modify aboveground effects of mustard oils as anti-herbivore defenses, and how interactions between the above- and belowground fitness effects of mustard oils result in the maintenance of genetic and trait diversity over space and time.","02/17/2017","02/17/2017","1701790","Thomas","Mitchell-Olds","tmo1@duke.edu","02/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Duke University","Durham","277054010","9196843030","2200 W.

It will promote scientific understanding of the fundamental principles of how to controllably push polymer-based materials systems away from equilibrium towards the successful generation of porous asymmetric membranes or highly ordered (""single-crystal"") nanostructures. The project may offer profound impact in a range of technologically important areas. For example, if successful, the project will provide advanced membrane materials for applications in high-resolution biopharmaceutical separations and will allow use of porous polymer molds to structure higher-melting materials like metals or semiconductors into periodically ordered porous single-crystal nanostructures of interest in the microelectronic industry. Besides expected benefits for society in a number of areas of technology development, the project will also support education and diversity by promoting interest of a diverse range of students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the synthesis and preparation, characterization, and formation mechanisms of porous block copolymer directed nanostructures obtained using non-equilibrium formation processes. Two distinct approaches will be pursued employing ABC triblock terpolymer self-assembly: One submits the terpolymers to non-solvent induced phase separation enabling asymmetric membrane formation, the other to transient laser heating to access temperature processing regimes hitherto unexplored for polymers. The aim of the proposed program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, physical and kinetic formation principles enabling generalization of results to other classes of materials. The proposed research includes synthesis of all components, preparation of porous nanostructured materials using the two non-equilibrium formation principles, and characterization of the final assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. The program will further involve training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, and industrial outreach.","02/17/2017","02/17/2017","1707836","Ulrich","Wiesner","ubw1@cornell.edu","02/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8396","Clean Energy Technology","8611","Energy Efficiency and End Use","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students. This project addresses strategic goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and critical needs of the nation related to enhanced global competitiveness and an improved national economy.<br/><br/>This project is grounded in the expectancy-value theory of motivation and will result in two sets of outcomes: research outcomes and direct benefits to participants. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the research outcomes will include: 1) contextually relevant and nationally representative research-based data we can use to inform the Institute's design regarding the success beliefs and values that contribute to and detract from students' dissertation success, 2) measures of Institute effectiveness in terms of participant's increased beliefs about succeeding in and the value of completing a dissertation, and 3) a list of variables to which academics should pay attention when designing transferable versions of the Institute. To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals. As a result of participation, students will gain specific skills in synthesizing and evaluating findings from the literature to aid in developing a dissertation proposal or for writing a dissertation. They will learn how to identify helpful, credible resources (people, physical and online) and how to use them effectively. Participants will also learn about developing and writing conference papers and publishable manuscripts from the dissertation, an important part of being ready for future employment. In combination, the project outcomes will have immediate impacts on participants while setting the stage for longer-term benefits.","02/17/2017","02/17/2017","1723314","Stephanie","Adams","sgadams@odu.edu","02/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Old Dominion University Research Foundation","Norfolk","235082561","7576834293","4111 Monarch Way","United States","Virginia","VA","7680","ENG DIVERSITY ACTIVITIES","110E","EDUCATION RESEARCH","7680","ENG DIVERSITY ACTIVITIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because they usually possess elevated privileges and have skills, knowledge, resources, access and motives regarding internal systems and data, insiders can easily circumvent security countermeasures, steal valuable data, and cause damage. Perimeter and host-based countermeasures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software are ineffective in preventing and detecting insider threats. Despite the availability of abundant anecdotal information regarding insider threats, research relying on field data to advance understanding of such threats is still lacking. This proposal presents a theoretically driven approach to investigate the risk of insider threat within financial institutions. It will utilize large scale field data from two financial institutions to provide comparison and improve the generalizability of results.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will use criminology theories and extend them to the domain of insider threat. It will use both objective log data from the enterprise single sign-on (eSSO) systems and subjective data through surveys and focus groups to understand perceptual characteristics of applications as well as perceptions of employees regarding attractiveness of targets. Thus, this research will be among the first that takes both the technical and human aspects into consideration in investigating victimization risk and attack proneness associated with information assets within financial institutions. In essence, the proposed study will utilize multi methods and multi-source data to establish how information resources can be better protected from misuse and abuse of access privileges. The study will initiate a new perspective for analyzing existing behavioral log data to improve the practice of risk management, which may have a transformative impact in terms of mitigating risks from different user groups and informing interventions to deal with the insider threat problem. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This multi-disciplinary collaborative project will deepen understanding of insider threat behavior in the context of financial institutions. A PhD student will be funded at each university and the research will result in a few Masters' independent studies in this area as well. The findings of this proposal will be disseminated among the law enforcement task forces, as well as banking organizations. The channels to be employed include workshops with the local InfraGuard program in collaboration with the regional FBI office. The outcomes of the proposal will not only provide an applied understanding of insider threat, but also important implications for risk management applications. It is important to note that the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board identified the banking and finance sector as one of the critical infrastructures to be secured. This proposal will help in this regard by having an impact on public policy with respect to regulations for financial institutions. The potential reduction in financial crime as a result would have significant societal benefits.","02/21/2017","02/21/2017","1724725","H.

The IEEE FG conferences are the premier international forum for research in image- and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. Their broad scope includes new algorithms for computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics, as well as machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture and body motion for a variety of applications. The conferences present research that advances the state of the art in these and related areas, leading to new capabilities in interactive systems, biometrics, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment, and they play an important role in shaping related scientific, academic, and educational programs. More information is available online at http://www.fg2017.org/. The Doctoral Consortium will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students whose dissertations are on topics related to automatic face and gesture recognition to present their proposed research, and receive constructive feedback from an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers, as well as from other students working in these areas. The event will give students valuable exposure to outside perspectives of their work, and provide a comfortable forum in which to discuss and fine-tune their career objectives with members of the international research community, and identify areas that need further development. The workshop will also enable these young researchers to develop a network of contacts at a critical stage of their careers, and will foster a supportive community of scholars and spirit of collaborative research, which will have broad impact because graduate students who are conducting creative and groundbreaking work are the foundation and future of the community. The organizers will make a particular effort to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities) and from smaller schools. <br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium will be a half-day event during the conference. There will be five distinct aspects to the event. Each student participant will be assigned a mentor based upon similarity of research interest and experience, who will discuss the work one-on-one with the student and provide constructive comments and guidance. There will be an oral session in which all participants present their research to the group. And there will also be a Doctoral Consortium poster session during the main conference, which will afford the students an opportunity to present their research to the rest of the community. Extended abstracts (up to 4 pages long) of the students' research will be published online on the FG 2017 website. Finally, students and mentors will all share a working lunch, in which mentors will briefly describe their career paths and student participants will ask the mentors questions about the different career paths. The combination of these five activities will provide an excellent and structured way for students to communicate with other students as well as with established members of their research community.","02/21/2017","02/21/2017","1733800","Yan","Tong","tongy@cec.sc.edu","02/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of South Carolina at Columbia","COLUMBIA","292080001","8037777093","Sponsored Awards Management","United States","South Carolina","SC","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7495",NA,NA,NA,"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The event will take place as part of the first day of activities at the 12th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2017), to be held March 6-9 in Vienna, Austria, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. HRI is the premier conference for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research on human-robot interaction, with roots in diverse fields including robotics, artificial intelligence, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, engineering, and many more. It is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that invites broad participation. Building on the ""Smart City Wien"" initiative, the theme of HRI 2017 is ""Smart Interaction."" The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction. More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2017. The Pioneers Workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities. This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI has expressed his strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups. To further ensure diversity the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, will recruit students who are just beginning their graduate degree programs in addition to students who are further along in their degrees, and will strive to limit the number of participants accepted from a particular institution to at most two. As a new feature this year, the organizers will also invite 3 undergraduate students (all eligible for funding) to help increase diversity in the pipeline of students entering this field.<br/><br/>The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop format will encompass a variety of activities including three keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions. To start the day, all workshop attendees will briefly introduce themselves and their interests. Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants will present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session. This will enable all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting. The workshop organizers will facilitate the post-presentation discussion and will encourage participants to ask questions of their peers during the interactive break and poster session. After lunch, the remaining workshop participants will give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session. Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) will be invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants will be invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well. The conversations between the panel and participants will continue over lunch and during dinner.","02/21/2017","02/21/2017","1724537","Brian","Scassellati","brian.scassellati@yale.edu","02/21/2017","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The workshops focus on analyzing archived Web data. Such data sources provide unique opportunities to examine social science phenomena that have evolved over time, such as how news media is presented on the Web or how individuals interact in online discussions. On the other hand, such data are often difficult to access and challenging to analyze due to the fact that the data were often captured using sporadic or random approaches, due to data formats that are opaque and not always standardized, and due to the large size of the data (mid-sized collections can be on the terabyte scale). The workshops will educate graduate students with regards to combinations of code and research questions that can be used to design appropriate research studies and to then access and analyze this type of data. <br/><br/>The focus of the workshops is interdisciplinary, bringing together research interests from disciplines as diverse as computer science, social science and the humanities Participants will work hands-on with data, will learn new programming skills, and will develop pilot projects for new research that they will be able to continue at their home institutions. For example, workshop participants will learn about the Warcbase software package (based on Spark and Scala), and will also have the opportunity to analyze data using in-browser Python notebooks. The first workshop will take place in February 2017 at the Internet Archive in San Francisco, CA, and the second workshop will take place in June 2017 at the British Library in London, UK. The first workshop will focus on the use of application programming interfaces for interoperability between collections and institutions. The second workshop will focus on establishing international collaborations between North American and European researchers, and will include a discussion of how to utilize archived Web data with other types of data such as socioeconomic variables. Data used and projects developed during the workshops will be published to the workshop website, and will also be made available via a GitHub repository. A final report will be produced summarizing the results of the workshop, and reviewing current state of the art research pertaining to archived Web data.

At the core of decision-making in such large and dynamic teams is team cognition, which in emergency response can be viewed as the responders' ability to form a ""common operating picture."" The goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to examine the relationship of cognition to individual and team performance in IMTs. While it is difficult to study actual IMTs at work, high-fidelity simulation facilities place responders in exercises that replicate real-world emergency events. This research leverages one such facility, the Emergency Operations Training Center (EOTC) operated by the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX), a world leader in emergency responder training, to study IMTs without the need to collect data during actual incidents (which would be both impractical and undesirable given the urgency of real events). Based on observations and recordings, the researchers will conduct a qualitative analysis of team communication and build social networks representing interactions among team members, which collectively form cognition in the team, according to recent findings. The researchers will break the team's work into its constituent elements and examine how each element makes use of key technologies. Because the work involves performance-oriented interventions, it will lead to improved responder training and thus will contribute to reduced loss of life and property during catastrophic events. The EOTC will be able to use research findings to guide redesign of software and training tools. As leaders in emergency management, EOTC instructors and staff are in regular communication with policymakers, enabling them to translate research outcomes into actionable information to improve the U.S. National Preparedness Guidelines, the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and state and local equivalents.<br/><br/>This research seeks to characterize the influence of interactions among humans, teams, and technologies on individual and team performance in high-pressure, time-constrained environments such as emergency response. In these situations, the IMT supports first responders from a centralized incident command post (ICP). The IMT solves complex safety-critical problems under high time pressure and ubiquitous information flow, so the team's ability to receive, process, and share information is essential to successful outcomes. Building on the view that team cognition is inseparable into individual cognition, the research focuses on the team as a singular entity, termed the ""aggregate team artifact."" Unlike traditional human-machine interaction (HMI) studies, this research examines two new complementary concepts: human-team interaction (HTI) and team-machine interaction (TMI). While HTI focuses on individuals' interactions with the aggregate team artifact, TMI applies HMI methods to the team entity's interactions with tools and technologies. The researchers will conduct a focused study to explore and validate HTI and TMI. During exercises involving actual emergency responders in high-fidelity ICP simulations, the work of the Planning subteam will be recorded and transcribed. Beginning with grounded theory analysis of transcripts, the researchers will categorize HTI and TMI content, build team communication networks to devise metrics of HTI, adapt task analysis techniques to assess TMI, and relate metrics of HTI and TMI to individual and team performance.

Klein","The 24th Developmental Biology of the Sea Urchin (DBSU) Meeting will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) from April 5-9, 2017 in Woods Hole, MA. Since 1980 this conference has been held approximately every 18 months to bring together the international community of developmental and cell biologists who use sea urchins as a model system for research. The recent deliberate inclusion of investigators working on other non-canonical model systems has made it a unique and important meeting for a broader community of developmental biologists. The DBSU meeting now includes participation of researchers working on the cell and developmental biology of other marine invertebrate models (e.g. other echinoderms, tunicates, hemichordates, cephalochordates, mollusks, cnidarians, ctenophores and sponges). There is no other meeting that focuses on the comparative development of marine invertebrates and the 24th 'Sea Urchin Meeting' will continue to serve as an important venue for promoting collaborations between scientists working on non-canonical marine invertebrate model systems. The meeting sessions, which are divided into plenary sessions, concurrent sessions and poster sessions, will highlight experimental findings that contribute to our understanding of how a fertilized egg becomes an embryo with many distinct cell types. Moreover, there will be sessions that address questions such as how stem cells arise, how animals regenerate lost body parts, and how changes in the marine environment are negatively impacting marine invertebrates. These questions are of great interest to the public and relevant to human health. The meeting will promote the participation of junior scientists and the participation of scientists from groups typically underrepresented in the sciences. In addition, this meeting will have an education session that will promote the use of marine invertebrate embryos in undergraduate teaching of developmental biology and in community outreach. <br/><br/>Marine invertebrate model systems have made major contributions to our current knowledge of many aspects of biology, including developmental biology. The diversity of marine invertebrate model systems that will be featured at this meeting will provide opportunities to continue the systems level comparisons of development and evolution in phylogenetically informative bilaterian and non-bilaterian taxa. This meeting will also highlight recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that specify embryonic polarity in oocytes and embryos, mechanisms regulating mitotic patterns, novel ideas on the evolution of nervous systems, gene regulatory network level analyses on morphogenesis, insights into the evolution of stem cells and regeneration, and the ecological and environmental influences on embryonic and larval development. In addition, there will be a session on application of relevant recently developed techniques (e.g. genome editing) to manipulate development in non-canonical marine invertebrates.","02/21/2017","02/21/2017","1727158","Athula","Wikramanayake","athula@miami.edu","02/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Miami","CORAL GABLES","331462926","3052843924","1320 S.

Mimi McClure","This project investigates how information from social networks may be used to create efficient and cooperative large-scale distributed data sharing systems. Two of the challenges facing such systems are locating data quickly and cost-efficiently, and enforcing cooperative node behaviors. Social network-based approaches seek to build social networks into data sharing systems in order to leverage the real-world friend properties of mutual trust and common interest. Although these approaches can significantly reduce cost and complexity compared to purely technical approaches, current methods only make use of a very superficial level of social network properties, and cannot support the broad goal of enabling all nodes to share data freely and efficiently. This project addresses these shortcomings through more fully leveraging social network properties, and coordinating social network-based approaches with technical approaches. Areas of investigation include infrastructures for data searching, cooperation enhancement mechanisms, and algorithms for data server selection. <br/><br/>Today, a multitude of large-scale distributed systems use the Internet to deliver a variety of data -- such as software and audio/video content -- to end users. These systems support many social, commercial, and cultural activities. Millions of dollars are spent on commercial servers to deliver this data. Peer-to-peer technology, in which user computers cooperate to share content between themselves, has potential for doing this cheaper and faster. However, wider use of peer-to-peer technology is held back by several limitations. One is that nodes may misbehave, selfishly receiving content but not contributing in return, or distributing corrupted or malicious content into the system, to be further spread by unsuspecting users. Another limitation is that locating content is difficult, due to the wide distribution of nodes and the lack of a central index. This project seeks to address these limitations by making use of information obtained from social networks. Potential benefits of the work include savings in the costs of infrastructure and energy consumption for data distribution. The project also provides educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborates with other educational programs for under-represented student recruitment, and outreach to K-12 students.","02/21/2017","02/21/2017","1733596","Haiying (Helen)","Shen","hs6ms@virginia.edu","02/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Virginia Main Campus","CHARLOTTESVILLE","229044195","4349244270","P.O.

Unlike<br/>single genome sequencing, assembly of a metagenome is intractable and<br/>is in large part, an unsolved mystery. Moreover, the advent of high<br/>throughput sequencing is fueling rapid generation of enormous<br/>metagenomic datasets. There is no available sequenced genome for a<br/>majority of the species. There is a need to determine the number of species in<br/>a metagenomic dataset as well as the abundance of each of these<br/>species. The key steps (Assembly and Clustering) in the metagenomics<br/>analysis algorithms are compute-intensive, while the sheer amount of<br/>data the algorithms operate on is staggering. The most promising way<br/>to tackle the computational challenges is to build special purpose<br/>hardware, dedicated solely to suitable algorithms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a range of flexible,<br/>affordable, parallel, fast hardware-accelerated bioinformatics<br/>solutions, using GPGPU, FPGA, and ASIC, for metagenomic analytics to provide an alternative to<br/>expensive computer clusters. Specifically, hardware solutions for<br/>metagenomic clustering and assembly will be developed. Several<br/>acceleration methodologies, including parallel software mapping and<br/>special hardware design, are proposed to explore the parallelism<br/>inside the applications and to improve the data access bandwidth in<br/>the hardware running bioinformatics applications.

Blood","Today, closed forests dominate the non-agricultural land in the North American Midwest, but data from before European settlement, less than 200 years ago, indicate that both open savanna and closed forests co-existed in the region. Such changes in forests are often attributed to changes in fire occurrence and frequency, but analyses of tree rings suggest other environmental changes such as rising CO2 and changes in weather patterns that may have contributed to shifts in forests and savannas. In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award funds will be used to measure tree ring carbon stable isotopes to estimate annual trends in water use efficiency across a network of savanna and forest sites to determine the mechanism for changes in tree growth and the trends observed in historical survey and ring-width data. A better understanding of the many factors responsible for changing forest cover in the past will help in understanding how anticipated future environmental changes might affect Midwestern forests: Hotter temperatures and drought stress could drive tree decline, pushing today's forests towards the savanna state. Alternatively, increases in CO2 may confer drought resilience by enhancing tree growth, and favoring forest expansion. These alternative trajectories for the Midwest create uncertainty in predicting future vegetation distribution and make it difficult for local land and forest managers to develop effective resource management plans. <br/><br/>The award funds will be used to test the hypothesis that increased atmospheric CO2 has driven past changes in tree growth and altered forest resilience to future changes. This research advances scientific understanding of how environmental changes affect Midwestern forest resilience and growth, and more broadly identifies the conditions where tree growth is resilient to environmental changes. This award builds on a network of sites where the researchers have developed annual tree ring growth records from 1850-2015 for oak trees in both closed forest and open savannas. From the annual trends in tree ring growth across these sites, the researchers have identified places where tree growth has increased since 1950 and where the growth-climate relationships change over time. Such shifts are consistent with CO2 driven enhancement of tree water use efficiency (carbon uptake by the tree per unit of water needed), which can theoretically drive increases in tree growth and improve drought tolerance in trees. However, growth data alone cannot determine if CO2 fertilization is the mechanism for these changes. Thus, researchers will use stable carbon isotopes in tree rings, which are related to water use efficiency, to determine the extent to which rising CO2 can explain changes in tree growth. Overall, this project will test whether CO2 enhancement played a role in stabilizing trends in Midwest forest cover, and will provide scientific insight into the conditions necessary for CO2 enhancement of tree growth.","02/22/2017","02/22/2017","1701897","Kelly","Heilman","kheilman@nd.edu","02/22/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Notre Dame","NOTRE DAME","465565708","5746317432","940 Grace Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jason","McLachlan","jmclachl@nd.edu","02/22/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils. It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry). <br/><br/>This award supports research activities that will examine issues surrounding freshwater security associated with the expansion of intensive crop agriculture in tropical forests. Intensification of crop agriculture is a global phenomenon that is rapidly shifting land use as populations and incomes increase. These agricultural changes have important implications for water use and quality, but land use changes are rarely associated with changes in water governance and management. This project will (1) identify how impacts from land conversion, cropland expansion and agricultural intensification interact to affect regional evapotranspiration, rainfall generation, river flooding, water quality and stream habitat and the thresholds of change that will endanger agricultural production, livelihoods and infrastructure, and (2) what mechanisms of governance and communication are best suited to facilitate effective and efficient water management. Farmers, ranchers, families, municipal officials and businesses will be engaged to assess what mechanisms can influence water security assessments and manage tradeoffs. This project will contribute toward an improved understanding of how shifts in land use impacts water use and governance and how engagement and management can impact freshwater sustainability in regions with rapidly changing land use.","02/22/2017","02/22/2017","1719263","Linda","Deegan","ldeegan@mbl.edu","02/22/2017","Principal Investigator","Woods Hole Research Center","Falmouth","025401644","5084441526","149 Woods Hole Road","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7313","REGIONAL INST FOR GLOBAL CHANG","1679","INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION ACT","7313","REGIONAL INST FOR GLOBAL CHANG","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE","OTHR","OTHER RESEARCH OR EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to their expressive power, in recent years regular expressions have been adopted in pattern-sets used for these applications in both industry and academia. Existing high-performance regular expression matching engines are based on finite automata, and are implemented using either logic- or memory-based designs. The former allow peak performance on single packet flows with relatively simple logic, but are not scalable to large numbers of flows; the latter offer scalability in the number of flows at the cost of algorithmic and design complexity. Despite the rich body of work in the area, providing worst-case guarantees is still challenging in the presence of complex regular expressions that include repetitions of wildcards and large character sets. Moreover, existing solutions assume that packets are inspected in-order and after data decompression. <br/><br/>This project will develop a language abstraction, data structures, and algorithms for line rate deep packet inspection. In particular, the project will consider open problems in regular expression-based deep packet inspection, namely: (i) handling of complex patterns containing repetitions of wildcards and large character sets, and (ii) inspection of out-of-order packets and compressed traffic. A language-based approach to deep packet inspection will be introduced in order to handle the regular expressions? complexity. This project will integrate concepts from automata theory, practices in data structure and algorithm design, analysis of the requirements of networking applications, and system architecture considerations. <br/><br/>The previous work performed by the PI on high speed regular expression matching has attracted the attention of several companies. The PI will leverage these contacts to facilitate the transfer of the proposed research. The PI has added two computer architecture courses to the undergraduate and graduate Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum at University of Missouri (MU); she will introduce a new networking systems course, which will cover the knowledge generated by this research. The PI will leverage the MU Undergraduate Research Program to involve undergraduate students in the proposed work, which will allow students to work at the intersection of three domains: algorithm and data structure design, system architecture and networking applications. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications and presentations, and by releasing open-source software modules on the PI?s Lab website.","02/22/2017","02/22/2017","1724934","Michela","Becchi","becchim@missouri.edu","02/22/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7923","SMALL PROJECT","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Black","This is a travel support for students, and some senior researchers from less developed countries, along with a small contribution to supplies and publication costs for a five-day international conference on geomagnetic substorm research. This meeting entitled, ""International Conference on Substorms (ICS13)"" will be held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire during 24-29 September 2017. The ICS13 will be the 13th in a series of carefully-designed substorm conferences that build on past advances while incorporating the latest new development. The venue is aimed at creating a forum to bring together a worldwide cadre of substorm researchers (and students) to focus their combined talents as well as theoretical and observational assets on accelerating progress towards a fundamental understanding of substorm physics. Such an environment, which intermixes a wide variety of viewpoints and diverse participants, provides a known incubator for new and innovative approaches that have the potential for enabling breakthroughs. This environment is also a valuable educational experience for students and an opportunity for international networking. The dates for the workshop were selected so that scientific team meetings for several operating scientific missions making relevant measurements might be organized to overlap with the conference. As many as 150 participants are anticipated with an estimated 35 participants requiring travel support - half of this participant support is requested from NSF, the other half from NASA. Following the event, a peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published in an open-access, electronic-only periodical to enable broad dissemination of the results.<br/><br/>Geomagnetic substorms, the topical focus of the conference, are explosive energy releases in geospace that have disruptive consequences in regions from near-Earth space, where weather, communications and national security satellites orbit; to the underlying upper atmosphere and ionosphere, where associated mega-ampere currents flow endangering vulnerable assets both in low-earth orbit and on the ground. There is even evidence to suggest that effects of this disruption may penetrate into the middle atmosphere through chemical-dynamical processes with potential, but so-far elusive, effects on ozone and climate variability. The triggers of these explosive energy releases are still not fully resolved and debates over the underlying mechanisms fuel one of the most long-lived controversies in geospace research.

Over half of the 3.5 million required manufacturing positions in the US are expected to go unfilled due to a ""skills gap"". Employment projections show a decline in conventional manufacturing jobs with marked growth in DM jobs. This VR instructional framework, targeted at two and four year programs, will not only advance the field of DM, but will also strengthen education by remedying the lack of clearly defined career/educational pathway(s) for entry-level DM technicians. <br/><br/>MANEUVER is developing an innovative multi-modal VR framework for DM instruction. This framework decouples the 3D DM database from functionalities, thus giving the instructional designer access through immersive, augmented, and desktop VR. Instead of pairing functionalities with the VR database, which prevents access by other modes, the decoupled approach allows for mode-independent approach, facilitating affordable access and broader implementation. The resultant curricular modules can be replicated for use on multiple machines without additional costs. During manufacturing process training, VR tools serve as a viable alternative offering a cost and material-efficient solution. Industry standard software and hardware is being used to develop and deliver advanced DM exercises for instructional and training purposes. Using a ""train-the-trainers"" approach, a replicable faculty development model is being developed for secondary and post-secondary institutions. By addressing regional and national entry-level workforce needs, the project benefits society and contributes to national economic progress and prosperity.","02/23/2017","02/23/2017","1700674","Wayne","Merrell","wmerrell@eicc.edu","02/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Purdue University","West Lafayette","479072114","7654941055","Young Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ge","Jin","ge.jin@pnw.edu","02/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Magesh","Chandramouli","magesh@pnw.edu","02/23/2017","Principal Investigator","Ismail","Fidan","ifidan@tntech.edu","02/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Imelda","Cossette","mel.cossette@edcc.edu","02/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because of this great need, the Welding Distance Community Outreach (WELDCO) program at West Hills Community College is designed to meet the needs for a growing sector of advanced welding technicians on the West Side of the California impoverished Central Valley. The program seeks to transport and make mobile a successful, face-to-face, welding program and offer it in geographically isolated areas within the service area of the college where career and technical education (CTE) has been historically very limited. Cultural changes will occur within the regional community as children of first-generation immigrants attain post-secondary education and gainful employment, thus creating a positive generational learning outcome. Further benefits will accrue to the region as adult learners, those already employed seeking to improve job skills, and the unemployed capitalize on the accessibility of this education program. The project will impact both the state and the nation as this education paradigm is shared with other community colleges and organizations for improving employer partnerships and growth. A robust project evaluation will study the impact of this project on business and industry and on the students and workers involved. <br/><br/>WELDCO is a cohort-specific curriculum design which includes variable integration of e-learning, Virtual Reality (VR) welding technology, and traditional training as a means of engaging nontraditional students. Formative and summative assessments will be employed to assess curriculum performance and modifications needed. The package takes full advantage of California legislative mandates and state funding for education programs (including high school pathways and post-secondary education) to enhance the impact on education and subsequent employment in the region. Students will benefit from the expanded internship opportunities and employer collaborations to help create a regional impact. This project focuses on 3 objectives: (a) development of a blended welding curriculum to integrate e-learning, VR instruction, and traditional classroom instruction that will lead to American Welding Society (AWS) certification; (b) optimization of course delivery to maximize efficiency, effectiveness, and engagement by addressing student cognitive preferences and learning styles; and (c) implementation of population specific recruitment to include Hispanic, minority, and female students.","02/23/2017","02/23/2017","1700614","Timothy","Ellsworth","timothyellsworth@whccd.edu","02/23/2017","Principal Investigator","West Hills Community College","Coalinga","932100000","5599342102","9900 Cody St","United States","California","CA","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brian","Boomer","brianboomer@whccd.edu","02/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Jackson State University (JSU) will design and develop nanoparticles which are sensitive to pH change and have biocompatibility and low toxicity and can be used for molecular imaging and therapeutics. The proposed project will strengthen the educational and research capacity at JSU, augment the ongoing research being conducted in the Department of Chemistry, and build collaborations both internally and externally. The project will allow undergraduate students to connect basic chemistry and materials science with potential application in biomedical engineering. The exposure of underrepresented minorities to cutting-edge research and instrumentation will result in students who are well-prepared for graduate school and well-qualified to compete in the Nation's STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance magnetic resonance (MR) signals in response to pH. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) synthesize and characterize poly(N,N-dipropyldopamine) nanoparticles (PDNPs) with pH sensitive components 2) develop new schemes to modify the surface of PDNPs to improve their solubility and for further functionalization; 3) prepare multifunctional PDNPs by intrinsically chelating with iron(III); and 4) evaluate the biocompatibility of nanoparticles by incubating with living cells. The development of the PDNPs will provide a procedure to prepare melanin-like nanoparticles with pH sensitive MR properties and photothermal effect. The structural characterization of PDNPs will provide information for the mechanisms of interaction of the metal ion with catechol groups. The project will not only enhance biomedical engineering research but also provide excellent education and training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students at JSU.

At least one mutant will be isolated for nearly every nuclear gene. Individual clones, as well as the complete library, will be distributed to the scientific community through the Chlamydomonas Resource Center. The mutant library will allow for the isolation and study of mutants in nearly all genes required for photosynthesis in green algae and plants. Furthermore, the library will also yield mutants in many highly conserved plant genes with putative roles in protein maturation and degradation, signaling, small molecule transport, redox regulation, lipid metabolism, and trace metal homeostasis. More broadly, half of the most widely conserved green plant genes remain completely uncharacterized. This resource will yield mutants in nearly all of these genes, and the study of these mutants will likely reveal entirely new pathways whose critical functions in plant biology are still not appreciated. This resource will also enable breakthroughs in other fundamental processes, including the green algal carbon concentrating mechanism, phototaxis, and the assembly and function of eukaryotic flagella.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Photosynthetic organisms provide energy, oxygen and organic building blocks for nearly all of the life on Earth. Plants are the origin of most of our food and many of our basic materials, and have important potential as a source of renewable energy and industrial chemicals. This mutant resource will lead to advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of plant biology, which will enable future increases in crop yields, the development of next-generation biofuels, and more informed policy decisions as human activities increasingly impact our environment. This resource will dramatically expand our knowledge of green algae, which will facilitate efforts to engineer these organisms for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and renewable fuels, and for bioremediation. Finally, use of this resource will provide countless opportunities for training early-stage biologists in genetics and the application of high-throughput, genome-wide approaches to basic plant biology questions.","02/23/2017","02/23/2017","1734715","Martin","Jonikas","mjonikas@princeton.edu","02/23/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is emerging as a foundational experimental research platform across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research in very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. <br/><br/>GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues: <br/><br/>1. Science Issues: We cannot currently fully understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks. <br/><br/>2. Societal Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience. <br/><br/>3. Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers exist to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies. <br/><br/>GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who among their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research.

Flexibility could facilitate evolution by creating new traits on which selection could act; alternatively, flexibility could hamper evolution by protecting genes for detrimental traits from being selected. Flexibility in mating behavior can be especially important because it could allow the maintenance of small or isolated populations, where available mates of preferred types are few, or play a role in the divergence of populations, ultimately leading to divergence of one species into two or more. This project addresses this fundamental question by examining how flexibility in mate preference could affect the evolution of courtship. During this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate participant will gain comprehensive research experience in behavioral ecology and bioacoustics. In addition, the researchers will engage in science education and outreach activities aimed at elementary school children, adults in non-science careers, and members of underrepresented groups in science via hands-on science activities, public appearances, and writing for non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This project examines how the experience of male song quality during development affects female mating behavior in the Pacific field cricket. Male crickets produce song that females use to identify and localize appropriate mates. Within Hawaii, the crickets experience a novel selection pressure against singing preferred songs: an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly that preferentially infests males with the same song characteristics preferred by female crickets. Recently, a mutation arose that makes male crickets obligately silent ('flatwing'). Female crickets strongly prefer singing males, and also have directional preferences about temporal properties of the song. Plasticity in expression of these preferences could facilitate maintenance of this population when available males of preferred phenotypes are few, but this plasticity could have consequences for the strength of selection on sexual signals. Indeed, both males and females reared in silence, mimicking an all-mutant environment, become more phonotactic, suggesting that mating behavior is plastic and selection on signals in nature may be relaxed. In this study, the researchers will rear crickets in acoustic environments that vary by the value of a preferred trait and use phonotaxis trials (females) and song recordings (males) to determine: 1) whether signal production is plastic; 2) whether expression of female mating preferences is plastic; 3) whether population differences in the extent of this plasticity support the hypothesis that plasticity in mating behavior is an adaptive response following the introduction of flatwing.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1701071","Marlene","Zuk","mzuk@umn.edu","02/24/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jessie","Tanner","tanne123@umn.edu","02/24/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yellen","Dr. Kristin De Lucia of Weber State University and Dr. Enrique Rodríguez-Alegría of the University of Texas at Austin will undertake research to investigate the roles of religion and ritual in the construction of power during the growth of empires and in situations of conquest. Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.<br/><br/>Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico. The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains.

If scientists could predict where or when pests would be worst, it could prevent financial losses. This project will provide direct insight into the specific role of the environment (climate, summer length, etc.) on pest pressure. The researchers will address this question in a wild plant species rather than a crop species. This is because pesticides and agricultural practices hide the influence of natural factors. The focal species in this study is pokeweed (and associated pests). Pokeweed is a culturally significant perennial plant native to the eastern USA. Prior research has shown that pokeweed is heavily eaten by caterpillars in the southern vs. northern US. This proposal checks if pokeweed's defenses against insects are stronger in the South. That pattern would suggest that the plants in the South have adapted to a long history of stronger pest pressure. In addition, the research will answer basic questions about how the environment influences relationships between plants and insects. It will also help to address the long-standing mystery of why ecosystems closer to the equator have more species than ecosystems at higher latitudes. The project will also enhance K-12 education through the creation of videos on latitudinal diversity for distribution to teachers.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that plants are better chemically defended at lower latitudes. The researchers will use a generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera exigua) to bioassay defense, and correlate caterpillar performance with leaf traits. Preliminary trials show that mortality is greater for S. exigua raised on a diet of pokeweed leaves from lower vs. higher latitude plants, suggesting that low-latitude plants are better defended. Lower latitude leaves are tougher, so to disentangle mechanical and chemical defense traits, ground leaves will be incorporated into agar for bioassays that test the effects of chemical defenses only. Liquid and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry will characterize leaf chemistry profiles, and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen will serve as an index of leaf nutritional value. In sum, the project asks which leaf traits predict caterpillar performance over a latitudinal gradient, advancing our understanding of geographic variation in plant defense and addressing recent controversy about the generality of stronger biotic interactions at lower latitudes.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1701602","Douglas","Schemske","schem@msu.edu","02/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Carina","Baskett","baskettc@msu.edu","02/24/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The low temperature silver reactive inks are projected to use 90 percent less silver than traditional screen-printing technologies. Additionally the low temperature process will use significantly less energy and utilize equipment with relatively low capital expenditures requirements and high throughputs. This technique is of particular importance to temperature sensitive devices and substrates, not only because the reactive inks do not require firing but also because low temperature screen printing silver paste are costly, even more so than their high temperature counterparts. Thus the path envisioned for this technology not only can radically change the cost structure of solar cells but it also has the potential of affecting other markets such as wearable electronics, flexible displays and building integrated devices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops findings in the field of evaporation-confined adhesion promotion and reactive ink chemistry. It is based on application of reactive inks to photovoltaics, optimization of adhesion pretreatments, and understanding of printing and drying kinetics of the multiple chemical solutions involved in the process. It has been demonstrated that the process can reduce silver consumption by an order of magnitude and obtain comparable high efficiency to a screen-printed heterojuntion device. It has been further demonstrated that the reactive silver metallization is compatible with the state-of-the-art smart wiring technology for module assembly, reducing the silver consumption even further. It has also been shown that the reactive ink printed modules can withstand damp heat accelerated testing without any signs of performance loses, corrosion or delamination of the modules.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1728673","Mariana","Bertoni","mariana.bertoni@asu.edu","02/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This I-Corps project is exploring the commercialization feasibility for a method to protect any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit system. There are many application areas where a method to form a rigid support system would be useful and transformative. For example, this method requires minimal, non-professional training and no water or external additives to catalyze the cure from liquid to solid. If results of this study suggest that this technology has merit as a medical device, it could transform the way patients are treated for broken bones, how victims are cared for in disaster relief areas, and how medical treatment is administered in the third world. Additionally, the current standard for protecting fragile objects during shipping is with polymer-reinforced paper, plastic peanuts, or sheets of air-puffed plastic. Objects of unidentifiable shapes could be more efficiently packed with this adaptable-fit technology. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to conduct commercialization feasibility research on a method for protecting any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit system. The proposed technology utilizes research in manufacturing techniques to develop a novel method for custom forming a rigid support structure around an amorphous shape. The method consists of a network of tubing that contains one or more liquids, such that an external stimulus may trigger the transformation of one or more of these liquids into solid form. The tubes connect in a lattice structure that allows them to expand and contract in order to fit to an amorphous shape. Exploring this new method of forming a rigid structure can advance the fields of custom manufacturing and rapid prototyping. The technology allows for rapid creation of a custom-fit part in the field, without any external tools.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1734697","Roger","West","rwest@illinois.edu","02/24/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current experiments show that the data processing throughput and latency are about one order of magnitude better than best known systems built for the same purposes. The research behind this technology complements current work in database systems and parallel computing fields. The system-oriented approach is in sharp contrast to existing GPU work that typically focuses on solving individual problems and thus highly creative.

Blood","Native grasslands once covering millions of acres across the US have been reduced to a tiny fraction of their former distribution. These remaining grasslands play important roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients, biodiversity, and as sources for restoration. The health and seasonal dynamics of the remaining native grasslands in the central US are controlled by the amount and timing of rainfall. Across the central US rainfall variability is predicted to increase, with greater frequencies of extreme wet and dry years expected. Grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to such changes, with evidence that these systems may be more sensitive to wet versus dry years. However, studies rarely include assessment of extreme years. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award, will experimentally assess the sensitivity of the grassland composition, carbon cycle, and nutrient cycling to rainfall extremes within an intact semi-arid grassland system. The research results will be valuable to natural resource and land managers in managing or restoring native grasslands. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in the research. <br/><br/>This research project aims to advance a fundamental understanding of how ecosystems will respond to predicted increases in environmental variability and extremity. The grassland ecosystem's response to rainfall extremes is hypothesized to be non-linear and bi-modal. A novel experimental treatment is proposed to expose semi-arid grassland to a large gradient of growing season precipitation that will be able to detect nonlinearities in response variables that are otherwise not detectable in few-factor experimental design. The research will allow assessment of the comparative sensitivities of key carbon cycle components to dry versus wet years, and how this sensitivity may change when precipitation transitions from moderate to extreme deviations from mean levels.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1701966","Melinda","Smith","melinda.smith@colostate.edu","02/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Colorado State University","Fort Collins","805232002","9704916355","601 S Howes St","United States","Colorado","CO","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrew","Felton","felton12392@gmail.com","02/24/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over evolutionary time, males and females can become very different from each other in behavior and structure, but the process behind this divergence is poorly understood. This research focuses on how social interactions shape the elaborate differences we see in nature. An excess of males or females can have a strong effect on many traits by changing how frequently an individual interacts with potential mates or rivals, and therefore how likely that individual's traits are to persist in later generations if they confer a mating or competitive advantage. Using the short-lived roundworm, this project measures the genetic differences between populations kept for 50 generations with mostly females, mostly males, or equal numbers of males and females. Analyzing genetic changes in these populations will reveal the processes by which evolution can alter traits in a population entirely due to male-female interactions. Moreover, comparing the genomes of multiple populations with an excess of males or females will address a core question in evolutionary biology: how similar are evolutionary trajectories when populations face identical conditions? This project will train undergraduate students from backgrounds underrepresented in science using modern genomic techniques, and produce online resources to educate high school students and the public about genomic methods and evolution.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to measure the genomic effect of selection on the differences between males and females and to quantify genetic changes resulting from the behavioral interactions that drive selection. Experimental evolution in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei has yielded evidence that populations faced with a consistently male- or female-biased ratio of reproductively available males to females show differences in morphology and behavior as a consequence of selection. This proposal expands the question of behavioral interactions driving evolutionary change by quantifying the degree of genomic divergence across populations, and identifying signatures of selection at outlier loci across the entire genome. The proposed study will be among the first to directly measure evolution across the genome after a known selective regime of biased ratios of males to females, and one of the few to do so using a behavioral regime. Because experimental treatments were replicated across independent populations, the project will also address the long-standing question of how repeatable evolution is at the nucleotide level. Revealing the genomic consequences of selection generated by behavior is essential to synthesizing proximate and ultimate approaches to understanding dimorphism at the phenotypic and genomic level.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1701420","H.

Present efforts to estimate water-column contributions to the measurement use a regional oceanographic model. This model, however, has difficulty estimating pressure variations from eddies and currents near the seafloor, which may be significant. During the project, special instruments will be placed near to the ocean bottom pressure recorders. These instruments will be able to measure the changing pressures from the overlying water column, allowing for a more accurate measure of the tectonic deformation that is occurring offshore. The project supports an early career faculty member from an under-represented group.<br/><br/>This project will quantify the water-column contributions to the signal from ocean bottom pressure recorders using in situ observations. Specifically, four Current and Pressure Recording Inverted Echo Sounder (CPIES) will be deployed offshore Oregon near existing ocean bottom pressure recorder benchmarks. CPIES are unique because they simultaneously measure bottom pressure, current, and round-trip acoustic travel time from the sea floor to the sea surface and back. By combining these measurements, the water signal can be separated from the measured bottom pressure signal. These measurements complement existing measurements and provide critical information to distinguish water column signal from tectonic signal for both long-term and transient signals. Methodology developed from previous physical oceanographic process studies will be applied and this effort will demonstrate the application for geophysical studies.","02/24/2017","02/24/2017","1728060","D.

Recently the PI has found a way to construct motives with exceptional Galois groups using automorphic forms and the geometric Langlands correspondence. This idea will be systematically developed in the following years and will have applications to the classical inverse Galois problem. The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character sheaves.<br/><br/>In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most interesting symmetries should arise geometrically. For example, the ancient classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all 'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space. With the revolution of algebraic geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the Langlands program. In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms). The predictions that Langlands made, if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way). Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry.","02/26/2017","02/26/2017","1736600","Zhiwei","Yun","zhiwei.yun@yale.edu","02/26/2017","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A multi-scale analysis will be conducted with the following objectives (i) to determine how the size, shape, and organization of deforested areas alter atmospheric dynamics; and (ii) to study how the atmosphere communicates these changes to intact areas of rainforest, other parts of South America and other parts of the world. Climate vegetation feedbacks will also be analyzed. One of the deliverables of this project is an integrated framework for understanding how Amazon deforestation affects local, regional, and global climate, hydrology, and ecosystems. This framework will be extended to analyze deforestation in tropical Asia and Africa.<br/><br/>The research focuses on integrating research and education at the Middle School level. The primary goal is to bring improved understanding of Earth's atmosphere, land surface, and human elements of global change into the middle school classroom. A new teacher-in-service unit will be developed and organized under the aegis of QUEST, a professional development program with a 25-year track record of success and administered by Princeton University's Program in Teacher Preparation. Students will gain hands-on experience collecting and analyzing local weather station data, and will also be taught how to access Amazon-relevant data from the Internet. Students will present their work at a local science fair. This research will also support a graduate student.

Each telescope allows astronomers in the US and the Gemini partner countries - Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Chile - to make unique observations of planets, stars, and galaxies. However, modern telescopes are only as good as the cameras and spectrometers used with them. It is therefore essential that a national observatory like Gemini continues to modernize the suite of instruments mounted on each telescope. The proposers aim to make available to the Gemini community an instrument that has already been built and tested on smaller telescopes. Funds are needed to support modest adaptation of the instrument so that it can be used on either Gemini telescope. The instrument, a spectrometer, will allow researches to analyze in great detail the infrared light from all manner of objects. Striking data have already been published and presented to the community at national astronomical meetings, demonstrating the power and versatility of the device. Important results and new discoveries are expected once the spectrometer is mounted on one of the much larger Gemini telescopes.<br/><br/>The proposal seeks to adapt the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), a near-infrared (H- and K-band) high-resolution (R~45,000) single-object spectrometer for use on either the Gemini-North or Gemini-South telescope. The proposers will also provide observational support for the community. IGRINS was built jointly by the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) as a precursor to a similar, future instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope. The instrument contains no moving parts and comes with an existing data reduction pipeline; the need for future development and support by Gemini staff is thus likely to be minimal. IGRINS has been used on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-meter telescope and at the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope, where its performance has been shown to exceed that of similar instruments at other 4-to-8 meter class telescopes. The proposers have already approached the observatory and have secured, through a competitive review process, 135 hours of telescope time in 2018 to pursue a ""Large and Long"" program to survey Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and planetary systems in Ophiuchius. The data -- to be reduced and archived for public use -- will represent the most extensive high-resolution, high-S/N, spectral survey of YSOs obtained to date, and will be a valuable resource to the star formation community.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1702267","Gregory","Mace","gmace@astro.as.utexas.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","1218","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES & INSTRM","1207","OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY","7697","INSTRUMENTATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Daniel","Jaffe","dtj@astro.as.utexas.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, given its interdisciplinary coverage, the project offers opportunities for training to both university students and industrial engineers, including curriculum development, student advising, outreach activities and workshop organization. It could improve the education infrastructure and generate high-quality researchers and practitioners in related fields. These education activities integrated with the proposed research tasks facilitate the transfer of the new design and optimization techniques to the technical community, and will potentially lead to a broader impact affecting the US semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>Aggressive technology scaling, large-scale process variation, rapid introduction of new standards and increased number of autonomous applications have made it necessary to develop resilient analog and radio frequency (RF) integrated systems that can adapt to all variabilities related to process, environment and standard. However, the design and optimization of resilient analog/RF systems has been considered as a grand challenge due to their irregular performance functions, discrete design spaces and high system complexities. This project exploits a novel optimization framework to efficiently design and implement resilient analog/RF systems. The framework is based on recent results optimization theory, and is expected to find the optimal design both efficiently (i.e., with low computational cost) and robustly (e.g., with guaranteed global optimum). The project would apply this technique to optimize resilient analog/RF systems that are composed of tunable analog/RF circuits, on-chip sensors and on-chip controllers.

Software professionals typically have no formal training or education on sociotechnical aspects of privacy. As a result, addressing privacy issues raised by a system is frequently an afterthought and/or a matter of compliance-check during the late phases of the system development lifecycle. To tackle this challenge, this research aims to bridge the gap between policy makers and regulators and system designers by making privacy laws and regulations understandable and actionable by software professionals. Specifically, this research designs and develops a deck of privacy ideation cards based on US privacy laws and regulations. The privacy ideation cards produced by this research can potentially transform how privacy-relevant aspects are handled in real-world software solutions built by industry and inform how students are taught these issues in undergraduate software curricula.<br/><br/>A critical contribution of this research is a deck of ideation cards to facilitate the design, development, and deployment of systems that take into account relevant US privacy laws and regulations at every step of the system building process.

The design is geared toward promoting an understanding of privacy regulation by software professionals as well as students. This research involves applying the cards to the design of real-world solutions in industry as well as at a university (in a software project course). These applications enhance the knowledge of how privacy-related ideation techniques can be effectively employed in professional software development as well as software education.

The 1500 species of cacti are among the most spectacular and evolutionarily successful groups of succulent plants in arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. Despite their remarkably diverse life forms and extreme physiological adaptations for life in arid, often hot habitats, genomic resources in Cactaceae are still very limited. This research team, with members from Arizona State University, the Desert Botanic Garden, and the University of Arizona, will provide fundamental genomic information and resources essential to our understanding of species diversity, ecology, photosynthesis and evolution of cacti, with expected impacts in basic science as well as horticultural and economic arenas. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups in science will be trained broadly in genomics, bioinformatics, computational, evolutionary and systematic biology techniques. Results from this project will be used to enhance an undergraduate genetics course and a biology education website at Arizona State University, and outreach programs at the Desert Botanical Garden. All data from the project will be deposited in public databases. <br/><br/>This project will focus on the unusual size and rearrangements of the plastid (i.e., chloroplast) genome within cacti, and in particular the loss of multiple genes critical to the process of photosynthesis observed in several large columnar North American species. The DNA sequence data generated will be used to produce complete plastid genomes, as well as identify multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, from a broad sampling of ecologically and morphologically diverse cactus species. This will enable an investigation of the distribution and pattern of specific structural genomic rearrangements and test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of these architectural changes. At the same time, the project will contribute data to generate a more robust phylogenetic framework for investigating the evolutionary relationships of specific groups of Cactaceae, as well as measuring rates of molecular evolution and mutation across the family. Reconstructing the history of gene losses and genome reconfigurations in this family of photosynthetic plants offers a system for studying genome variation and evolution under the selective pressures of life in the desert environment.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1735604","Kelly","Steele","kelly.steele@asu.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martin","Wojciechowski","mfwojciechowski@asu.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lucas","Majure","lmajure@dbg.org","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Michael","Sanderson","sanderm@email.arizona.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The underlying motivation for the Institute is to attract more students into graduate work in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and facilitate their transition into research work at a time when demand for human resources with data analytic skills easily exceeds the supply. The RUSIS@UNR program will prepare students to compete globally in a vibrant world where data-driven decisions are becoming more prominent in all human endeavors. While the program has been successful in motivating and enticing students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences, it also provides the necessary tools for students to join the workforce in a wide range of professional positions. From academic jobs, to jobs in the pharmaceutical companies, private industry, government agencies and national laboratories, professional sports as data analysts, and climate scientists, the job outlook for statisticians and data scientists is excellent. <br/><br/>The RUSIS@UNR objectives will be accomplished through the following mechanisms: (1) Mentoring and research supervision, of 15 selected underrepresented minority undergraduate students and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution, through an intensive core course in probability and statistics. In addition, topics in stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest will be discussed; (2) Engaging the students in research projects from areas of current interest. Statistical thinking is ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life. Data Mining, Big Data, Data Analytics, Knowledge Discovery are terms that have been coined in the past to denote essentially the same thing: activities related to the extraction of information from data to advance science, technology, and society. Statistics provides the tools (from concepts and methods to algorithms to operational software) needed to extract valid and reliable information from large data sets of diverse origin, and provides the methodologies to validate the models and quantify the inherent uncertainty. The students will engage in projects selected from (a) areas of genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, gene annotation, brain imaging, that rely to a very high degree on large and high-dimensional data sets, (b) environmental sciences, geophysics (including climate studies) astrophysics, cosmology, that regularly collect terabytes of high-dimensional data containing essential information about our World, and rely on knowledge extraction using tools inherent in statistical techniques, and (c) autonomous systems (e.g. autonomous cars) that make use of statistical techniques such as pattern recognition, statistical learning, and dimension reduction methodologies. In the last few years, there have been several national initiatives that require new statistical tools and theories, as well as an increased production of modernly trained statisticians. Prominent among these initiatives are: The brain initiative, the smart power grid initiative, big data and data analytics, climate change, and precision medicine; (3) Students will present their results at national meetings and they will be mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks.

Algebraic combinatorics is the underlying theme of the workshop and school; it is a vast area of mathematics concerned with the development of tools for analyzing, organizing, and arranging discrete data. The workshop and school will enhance the development of combinatorial methods essential in areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and physics. Emphasis is on the creation of combinatorial techniques for attacking problems in algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics. The program will promote the use of and training in an open-source computational symbolic algebra system, SAGE. <br/><br/>The workshop is a forum for the communication of recent developments on a body of problems in representation theory, algebraic geometry and topology, and theoretical physics with common combinatorial underpinnings. The focus is on rectangular Catalan combinatorics, relating varied areas such as representation theory of diagonal harmonic polynomials and coinvariant spaces, flag bundles over the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane, affine Springer fibres, and Khovanov-Rozansky homology of torus knots. Three lecture series will run during the summer school preceding the workshop. The speakers, known for both their communication and academic excellence, were choosen for differing viewpoints on similar problems in equivariant combinatorics. The school will broaden participants' perspective and will enable them to more fully benefit from the subsequent workshop talks. There will also be ample opportunity to share code and gain experience with the open-source SAGE-Combinat computer algebra system. Participants will leave equipped to help colleagues at their home institutions begin mathematical experimentation in SAGE.<br/><br/><br/>Details of the program can be found at http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2017/Equivariant17/index_e.php.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1723851","Jennifer","Morse","morsej@math.drexel.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","Drexel University","Philadelphia","191021119","2158955849","1505 Race St, 8th Floor","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7970","Combinatorics","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polyelectrolytes are large water-soluble molecules that contain electric charges. When water solutions of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes are mixed together, complexes are often formed that have either liquid-like or solid-like properties. The ability to tailor these properties has led to their use in a variety of applications, ranging from personal care to industrial waste processing and water treatment. This project is aimed at understanding how the relevant properties of these materials originate from the detailed structure of the components from which they are formed. This understanding will be generated by developing a series of well-characterized model materials systems, and studying their mechanical properties with several experimental techniques. In addition, new processing methods will be developed that enable polyelectrolyte complexes to easily be coated onto different material surfaces. The characterization methods include the use of high frequency sound waves to probe the material response. This technique is widely applicable to a variety of coatings with both protective and aesthetic functions. The project is relevant to membranes for water filtration and includes education and research training of students, broadening participation, and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polyelectrolyte complexes formed by the interaction of oppositely charged macromolecules are an important class of soft, polymeric materials. These materials are of interest largely because of their mechanical and transport properties. The mechanical properties can span the full spectrum of behaviors from low-viscosity liquids to tough viscoelastic materials to brittle solids, in a manner that can be reversibly controlled through changes in the salt concentration or pH. The primary aim of this project is to understand the factors that control this behavior using well-characterized model systems. A secondary aim is to use this information to develop surface modifications to enhance the performance of membranes used for water purification. The focus of the project is on polyelectrolyte complexes in thin film form, both because of the utility of these materials as surface modifiers, and because the thin film geometry is particularly convenient for the proposed investigations. There are three aspects of these investigations, beginning with new deposition mechanisms based on the electrochemical control of the pH at the surface of interest. The second set of experiments is aimed at mapping out the phase behavior of these materials, including the relationship between equilibrium water content of a film and the salt concentration of the aqueous medium with which it is in contact. The third element of the proposed program is the most extensive, and involves mechanical characterization of the polyelectrolyte complex films. Acoustic methods will be used to characterize the linear viscoelastic properties of these materials on a time-scale of about 60 nanoseconds, approaching the timescale that is accessible by molecular dynamics simulations, bridging the gap between experiment and computational modeling. In addition, the nonlinear properties of these materials will be investigated using creep and fracture experiments designed specifically for investigations of thin films in the hydrated state.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1710491","Kenneth","Shull","k-shull@northwestern.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1773","POLYMERS","004Z","Innovations at the Nexus of Food-Energy-","8249","Sustainable Materials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Topology studies the mathematical properties of ""spaces,"" from the physical 3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional space-time in which we carry out our daily lives, to much more abstract spaces such as the space of all possible configurations of a robot or all possible solutions to an equation. This conference will bring together about two hundred topologists from around the world to share state of the art knowledge, hear talks from a select group of internationally renowned experts on the most important research results of the past eight years, and develop new collaborations. This conference has a history of showcasing groundbreaking work and inspiring many generations of topologists, and this year's iteration will continue that tradition. This grant will support travel expenses for graduate students, early career researchers and speakers.<br/><br/>The purpose of the 2017 conference is to have the most important results obtained during the last few years in geometric topology and related geometry presented to a wide topological audience,including a large number of students and recent PhD's, and to introduce young mathematicians to the techniques underlying these results. The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in hyperbolic three-manifolds, mapping class groups, symplectic rigidity and flexibility, contact topology, and invariants of knots, three-manifolds, and four-manifolds. Historically this meeting has generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD's. Special attention is given to inviting young researchers in topology to speak. The combination of speakers and topics to be presented will offer students and fresh Ph.D.s a great opportunity to listen to and interact with the leaders in the subject as well as with successful mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. To complement the research talks, a series of expository lectures are scheduled that will introduce young mathematicians to the major themes of the conference. Previous proceedings of the Georgia Topology Conference have been among the best of any conference proceedings. Continuing with the tradition, all of the speakers will be invited to submit articles and conference participants will be enlisted to help review submitted articles for the proceedings.The conference website is at: https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/content/2017-georgia-international-topology-conference","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1719320","David","Gay","dgay@uga.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","ATHENS","306021589","7065425939","310 East Campus Rd","United States","Georgia","GA","1267","TOPOLOGY","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gordana","Matic","gordana@math.uga.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michael","Usher","usher@math.uga.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","William","Kazez","will@math.uga.edu","02/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rankins","Research Initiation Awards provide support for faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building a research program. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Howard University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project seeks to investigate mathematical models that originate from geometrical optics. The research crosses the fields of mathematics, engineering and physics and has potential applications in the synthesis, design and manufacturing of optical systems in an efficient and cost effective manner. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of mathematics courses.<br/><br/>The refractor problem is an inverse problem in geometric optics that is related to modeling of interface surfaces between two media that have different optical properties. The goal of this work is to obtain and analyze surfaces which are capable of redirecting light rays emanating from a point source located in one of the media into a set of directions or onto a specific target located in the other media, in such a way that the input and output intensities of the rays are prespecified. The application of the laws of geometric optics and conservation of energy principles to formulate the mathematical model will naturally lead to second order nonlinear partial differential equations of Monge - Ampère type. The determination of the surfaces will incite problems of existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations and mass transport problems. The specific objectives of this project include: developing a computational algorithm for the near field refractor problem in isotropic media, formulating mathematical models of geometrical optics problems in anisotropic media such as crystals, finding numerical and analytical solutions for near field and far field refractor problems in anisotropic media and investigating the regularity of analytical solutions for near field and far field refractor problems in anisotropic media. The consideration of anisotropic media will advance the mathematical theory of geometric optics problems to media of propagation that are more general and will make it more amenable to several optics applications including optical devices, design of freeform refractive beam shapers and laser optics.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1700236","Henok","Mawi","henok.mawi@howard.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","Howard University","Washington","200599000","2028064759","2400 Sixth Street N W","United States","District of Columbia","DC","1594","HIST BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIV","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Global society requires citizens and a workforce that are literate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but many U.S. students remain ill prepared in these areas. At the same time, the children who fill U.S. classrooms increasingly speak a non-English home language, with the highest concentration in the early grades. Many young children are also at risk for lack of school readiness in language, literacy, mathematics, and science due to family background factors. Educational efforts to offset early risk factors can be successful, with clear links between high quality early learning experiences and later academic outcomes. SciMath-DLL will help teachers provide effective mathematics and science learning experiences for their students. Early educational support is critical to assure that all students, regardless of socioeconomic or linguistic background, learn the STEM content required to become science and mathematics literate. Converging lines of research suggest that participation in sustained mathematics and science learning activities could enhance the school readiness of preschool dual language learners. Positive effects of combining science inquiry with supports for English-language learning have been identified for older students. For preschoolers, sustained science and math learning opportunities enhance language and pre-literacy skills for children learning one language. Mathematics skills and science knowledge also predict later mathematics, science, and reading achievement. What has not been studied is the extent to which rich science and mathematics experiences in preschool lead to better mathematics and science readiness and improved language skills for preschool DLLs. Because the preschool teaching force is not prepared to support STEM learning or to provide effective supports for DLLs, professional development to improve knowledge and practice in these areas is required before children's learning outcomes can be improved.<br/><br/>SciMath-DLL is an innovative preschool professional development (PD) model that integrates supports for DLLs with high quality science and mathematics instructional offerings. It engages teachers with workshops, classroom-based coaching, and professional learning communities. Development and research activities incorporate cycles of design-expert review-enactment- analysis-redesign; collaboration between researcher-educator teams at all project stages; use of multiple kinds of data and data sources to establish claims; and more traditional, experimental methodologies. Based on initial evidence of promise, the SciMath-DLL project will expand PD offerings to include web-based materials, making the PD more flexible for use in a range of educational settings and training circumstances. An efficacy study will be completed to examine the potential of the SciMath-DLL resources, model, and tools to generate positive effects on teacher attitudes, knowledge, and practice for early mathematics and science and on children's readiness in these domains in settings that serve children learning two languages. By creating a suite of tools that can be used under differing educational circumstances to improve professional knowledge, skill, and practice around STEM, the project increases the number of teachers who are prepared to support children as STEM learners and, thus, the number of children who can be supported as STEM learners.","02/27/2017","02/27/2017","1726082","Alissa","Lange","langea@etsu.edu","02/27/2017","Principal Investigator","East Tennessee State University","Johnson City","376141707","4234396000","P O Box 70565","United States","Tennessee","TN","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because mathematics is a fundamental part of all STEM disciplines, success of undergraduate students in mathematics is a crucial ingredient in addressing this challenge. This ""TPSE Math Chairs+1 Conference #2"" project, with leadership team from the Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics (TPSE Math) group, will organize and convene a conference primarily of mathematical sciences department chairs and other academic leaders from a diverse set of institutions of higher education from across the country. This is the second conference of this nature with the first having been held in October, 2016 (NSF 1651738). Workshop topics will include several key questions and issues to be addressed to catalyze improved teaching, learning, retention, and overall student success in undergraduate mathematics. <br/><br/>Although recent education research has provided the STEM education community with indications and suggestions for various directions for change to improve undergraduate teaching and student learning, this community as a whole has not always been quick to foster such changes. Among the purposes of the workshop will be to encourage more collaboration among members of the mathematics community, help department chairs develop capacities to catalyze change in their own departments, and serve as a vehicle for chairs with common interests to work together for change after the conference, especially in areas of developing more diverse and modern curricula for mathematics majors and non-mathematics majors alike. To help guide the discussion and conference outcomes, the conference organizers with input from participants plan to address a wide range of questions and determine research needed to address them. The questions and categories include: (1) What do the various STEM disciplines want for their students who take mathematics? What mathematical training do other disciplines want for their majors? Is this training appropriate for careers in those disciplines? (2) What kinds of mathematical sciences training do employers want? Do employers in fact know what mathematics training can be most useful for their employees? (3) <br/>What are the levels of career satisfaction experienced by students who have - and have not - taken particular mathematics courses or pathways? (4) What menu of mathematics training best supports basic numeracy (general quantitative and reasoning skills) for citizens in today's society? and (5) Why are the current post-secondary pathways variations of algebra and calculus unsatisfactory? What should replace them? The conference also will showcase extant models, resources, and research results, and participants will be asked to suggest how they can be adopted, adapted, disseminated, scaled up, and evaluated, and to recommend what additional research is needed.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1725394","Phillip","Griffiths","pg@ias.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","Institute For Advanced Study","PRINCETON","085404907","6097348000","EINSTEIN DRIVE","United States","New Jersey","NJ","1998","IUSE","8209","Improv Undergrad STEM Ed(IUSE)","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stark","Differential Geometry studies shapes of spaces through distances and angles. Mathematically the concept of curvature plays the central role. Partial differential equations (PDEs) arise naturally from many fundamental questions in Differential Geometry, notably in understanding a geometric space in terms of its curvature or finding an optimal geometric structure on a given space. The PI will focus on two important examples: minimal submanifolds and geometric flows. Minimal submanifolds are subspaces that locally minimize area (or volume). They have been studied since the work of Euler and Lagrange, yielding many applications to geometry and other related fields such as low-dimensional topology and general relativity. Moreover, they are important models for many interesting non-linear phenomena in nature and a variety of ideas developed in their study have turned out to be key in the calculus of variations, geometric PDEs, and mathematical physics. A geometric flow, on the other hand, is a process of deforming a given geometry through a parabolic system of PDEs coming from curvature. A prominent example is the flow by the Ricci curvature, or Ricci flow, which has had seminal consequences to the geometrization of three-dimensional spaces by the work of Hamilton and Perelman. <br/><br/>One of the tenets of this research project is that the existence of minimal submanifolds of certain topological and Morse index type can impose restrictions on the curvature of the ambient manifold, and vice-versa. The PI will investigate several questions relating the Morse index and the topology of minimal submanifolds in presence of positive curvature. Another aspect is the singularity formation phenomena in geometric flows, with a focus on the profiles of singularities and their rigidity and stability properties.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1737006","Davi","Maximo","maximo@math.stanford.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","191046205","2158987293","Research Services","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1265","GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An example of such a problem is calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of the local gravitational field. Only rarely can such inverse problems be solved analytically, and in general numerical approximations are required to find solutions. In this research project, the investigators aim to introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems, develop its theoretical and computational properties, and establish its performance in applications. It is anticipated that the new algorithm will be adaptable to a range of problems currently under investigation in applied and numerical mathematics, for example in solving a sparse system of linear equations, currently of great interest in areas including tomography, archaeology, astrophysics, and other sciences.<br/><br/>This research project explores a novel iterative algorithm for the solution of a class inverse problems that includes Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, Laplace transform inversion, mixing distribution estimation in statistics, and solving sparse systems of linear equations. The investigators plan to (i) introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems of these types, and perhaps others, (ii) develop its theoretical and computational properties, and (iii) establish its performance in applications. A motivation for the research is the statistical problem of estimating a mixing density in a nonparametric mixture model. To date, there are no general algorithms that produce globally consistent estimators of the mixing density, in the sense of almost sure convergence with respect to a strong metric; only weak convergence results are available. An important feature of the algorithm under development is that, if it is initialized at a smooth density function, then the estimator is necessarily also a smooth density function. Other algorithms designed by numerical analysts for solving these inverse problems do not have this closure property. The form of the novel iterative algorithm, along with the fact that it yields smooth density estimators, suggests that this open problem can be solved; the investigators aim to establish a general global consistency result and demonstrate rates of convergence.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1737929","Ryan","Martin","rgmartin@uic.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","1269","STATISTICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Szekely","Statisticians frequently encounter problems that involve complicated models with high-dimensional parameters, particularly in ""big data"" settings. From a Bayesian perspective, it is imperative in these problems that the prior distribution be chosen to sit in a good position. Information about where is a good starting position can come from the data. There is a potential danger with this basic strategy, namely, that a double use of data might cause the model to track the data too closely, resulting on over fitting. To avoid this, the PIs introduce a regularization technique that suitably re-weights the likelihood, preventing the model from learning too quickly. This general ""double empirical Bayes"" strategy, where the prior is centered on the data and the likelihood is re-weighted, will be applied to several important and challenging high-dimensional problems, including estimation of sparse high-dimensional precision matrices, which is relevant to estimation of large complex networks. <br/><br/>In this project, the PIs will develop this new double empirical Bayes framework for inference on high-dimensional parameters with a relatively low ""complexity"" or ""effective dimension"". For example, in function estimation problems, posited smoothness on the function is a constraint on its complexity. The first step of the double empirical Bayes strategy is to use a prior, indexed by the complexity of the parameter, centered at a complexity-specific estimate of the parameter based on data. To prevent the posterior from tracking the data too closely, the second step is to re-weight the likelihood to be combined with the data-dependent prior. The result is a sort of posterior distribution on the parameter space, and the PIs will provide general conditions for this posterior to concentrate around the truth at optimal rates. An additional advantage of this new approach is that the complexity-specific priors, for suitable centering, can be taken of relatively simple form, which facilitates computation. The PIs will investigate the double empirical Bayes analysis of several important high-dimensional inference problems, including density and function estimation, variable selection problems in non-linear models, and estimation of sparse precision matrices. Software will be developed for each application.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1737933","Ryan","Martin","rgmartin@uic.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","1269","STATISTICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The emergence of new sign languages can provide insights into how human language evolves. To date, however, studies of the phenomenon are retrospective in nature beginning ten or more years after the deaf children were brought together. This means that we know little about how deaf children share their idiosyncratic gestures, known as 'homesign', to create a common sign language. In March 2016, 35 deaf children who currently communicate via homesign gestures were brought together for the first time in two all deaf classrooms in Iquitos, Peru. This project gathers data on the individual deaf children's gesture and their initial inter-personal communication using these gestures. The goal is to understand the very first stage of language emergence. The unique insight of this investigation is the gathering of data about the deaf children's gestures before they meet other deaf children and how their gestures change throughout their first year of interaction with one another. In reality, deaf children across the world frequently grow up without access to a shared language. The data gathered in the present study will provide the first documentation of how children's communicative interactions via gesture become codified into the initial symbols and symbolic utterances that form the basis of language. The study will also provide insights into how a low-tech and inexpensive means to facilitate sign language acquisition for isolated deaf children can be used to educate deaf children throughout Latin America and the developing world. <br/><br/>Researchers have long hypothesized that bringing together deaf children who have not had access to a conventional language in either speech or sign will result in the emergence of a new sign language from the deaf children's idiosyncratic gesture systems. One such well-known situation is the emergence of Nicaraguan Sign Language, NSL, which has been used to model language evolution (Senghas 2003; Senghas & Coppola 2001; Senghas et al 2004). Because research on NSL only began 10 years after deaf children of Managua were first brought together in a school, the available data and research on sign language emergence is purely retrospective in nature. The crucial, initial stages of sign language emergence have never before been observed or studied. Data essential to investigate the emergence of a new sign language in Iquitos, Peru will be gathered from individual children and groups of deaf children with respect to emerging lexical forms and utterance structure, or syntax. Spontaneous and elicited data have already been gathered from each child while communicating via gesture with his or her family prior to school enrollment. The individual child data will continue to be gathered on a yearly basis. At the group level, the deaf children's spontaneous communication with each other will be videotaped in the classrooms at regular intervals throughout their first year together. This data, at both the child and group level, will be gathered (1) prior to, (2) during, and (3) after one year's time of the children's initial contact. The data with will yield unique observations about when and how a sign language emerges from children's idiosyncratic gesture systems. Although research suggests that sign languages emerge quickly in school settings when deaf children are brought together for the first time, the contribution of each child's gesture system to the initial organization of the group's emerging sign language is currently unknown. With the opportunity to document language emergence from inception, the proposed study will fill this theoretical gap by mapping the relation of each child's pre-existing gestural system and ability onto his or her subsequent learning of others' gestures and signs.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1724718","Rachel","Mayberry","rmayberry@ucsd.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-San Diego","La Jolla","920930621","8585344896","Office of Contract & Grant Admin","United States","California","CA","004Y","Science of Learning","059Z","Science of Learning","1311","LINGUISTICS","1698","DEVELOP& LEARNING SCIENCES/CRI","7914","RAPID","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1311","1698",NA,NA,"LINGUISTICS","DS - Developmental Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience. It was started more than 20 years ago to provide a forum for the brain-mapping scientific community to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-two highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting to be held in Vancouver, Canada. Travel awards will be given to 30 students with high-ranking abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled. <br/><br/>The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low. In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively very high. Hence, the ability to work in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience. As neuroimaging is used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines, we would expect benefits for society in areas ranging from economic and social policies to medical, educational and psychological interventions.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1731924","Michael","Greicius","greicius@stanford.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","1699","COGNEURO","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","1699","COGNEURO",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To reshore jobs, improve operations, and recruit, retain, and retrain skilled workers, companies are increasingly using robotics technology. Ideally, robots will not replace humans but team with them to improve productivity. However, most industrial robots are poorly integrated into human workflow, causing expensive work stoppage problems ($1.7M per hour), worker stress, and talent loss. The research goal of this project is to address this problem by designing novel methods to improve human-robot workflow and productivity in assembly manufacturing through the use of an intelligent material delivery system (IMDS), which will closely integrate with and support the manual work process. This project will investigate innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to this research area, dramatically advancing the state-of-the art in smart manufacturing and human-centered robotics. <br/><br/>The research team will make the following contributions to human-centered smart service systems: 1) Revolutionize the use of robotics in assembly manufacturing processes to closely support skilled human workers, enabling them to focus on tasks they value (their trade) as opposed to tasks that distract from their talent (material movement). 2) Dramatically improve the productivity and flexibility of factories through nimble, real-time scheduling of an IMDS system that dynamically incorporates real-time models of human workflow. 3) Deeply explore the socio-technical implications of having an IMDS system in the workplace, in terms of human workers' cognition, fatigue, affect, and job satisfaction. The project's approach serves as a direct contrast to industry state-of-the-art, which relies on strict bifurcation of human and robot work, and rigid delivery schedules that fail to take local trim-line variations into account. By closely integrating an IMDS into the manual work process and understanding worker and material status, the project will readily enable flexibility and reconfigurability of a human workforce, an absolute necessity in made-to-order, small-batch manufacturing settings. <br/><br/>This project will help the US manufacturing sector dramatically improve their operations by using automation to directly support a talented, skilled workforce. It has the potential to impact all major US manufacturing sectors, including automotive, construction, healthcare, energy, and goods. It will help US companies reshore operations, as well as create new opportunities for US worker STEM skill acquisition. Furthermore, this project involves a detailed investigation of multiple human worker implications of the transition from traditional to intelligent material delivery using robotics. By understanding reactions to such change, there will be new understanding on how to optimize a system not only for workflow and task efficiency but also for the human experience. Such knowledge is critical to maintaining job satisfaction, safety and health, and long-term well-being of the human workforce.<br/><br/>The lead institution is the University of Notre Dame, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics (Cambridge, MA) and University of Colorado at Boulder, Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering (Boulder, CA).

Such professions include hazardous cargo trucking, heavy machinery operation, security and defense, air traffic control, etc. Indeed, technology for acquiring rich biosensor data streams that capture brain function, e.g., electroencephalography, are becoming increasingly portable and noninvasive. These developments present an opportunity for implementing not only real-time monitoring, but also providing pre-emptive alerts (e.g., smart phone displays), which can be used to indicate degradation in physiological states. This research has direct applications in biomedical settings - for instance, epilepsy, is one of the most common neurological disorders afflicting over 50 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the U.S. In about 25 percent of these patients, epileptic seizures are not controlled using available medications. Being able to detect (or predict) the onset of epileptic seizures would significantly enhance the patient's quality of life. In a proof-of-concept study, the novel analytical approaches by the research team detected the onset of epileptic seizures within 2.5 seconds. In contrast, existing approaches have a detection delay exceeding 7 seconds. From a broader perspective, the findings of this research can transform the status quo in real-time monitoring of neurophysiological function. The multidisciplinary research team will strive to provide state-of-the-art research and training opportunities for a diverse group of students that bridges the gap from engineering to the life and brain sciences. <br/><br/>The research team will develop a sensor data fusion approach based on graph theoretic topological mapping to combine data acquired from multiple biosensors for neurophysiological change point detection. Unlike existing approaches, which rely on complex signal pre-processing, the graph theoretic approach eschews these computationally demanding steps and is therefore more viable in a practical setting. The research team will exploit this framework using a data library of high-resolution neurophysiological recordings acquired from end users in realistic settings that induce shifts in global functional states (e.g., acute stress, cognitive exhaustion, and fatigue and so on). The research team will integrate automated decision-making approaches in the overall schema to synthesize the information and provide easily interpretable feedback to the end user (e.g., displays on a smart device). Furthermore, the PIs will customize biosensors to accommodate the patient's lifestyle.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1719388","Prahalada","Rao","rao@unl.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Lincoln","685031435","4024723171","151 Prem S.

In addition, decision makers are often required to consider multiple and conflicting performance criteria when faced with such problems. Despite their ubiquity and wide-ranging impact, risk-averse optimization problems that involve multiple criteria, discrete decisions and recourse actions are not well studied. The goal of this project is to bridge this gap by developing novel models and effective methods that will enhance our knowledge base, and enable the solution of more realistic and general risk-averse multicriteria optimization problems. In particular, the problems that will be studied are prevalent in homeland security and humanitarian relief applications. By developing models and effective methods for such problems, this project will improve our ability to prepare for and respond to national emergencies.<br/><br/>This project involves three major thrusts that will advance the development of models and methods for risk-averse multicriteria optimization. First, in the realm of single-stage optimization, a novel model for risk-averse multiobjective optimization is proposed, where the relative importance of the multiple criteria is ambiguous. To this end, a new robust multivariate risk measure with desirable theoretical properties must be defined. In this project, the problem of optimizing such a risk measure will be formulated as a concave minimization problem for which effective solution methods will be developed. Second, a rigorous study of the fundamental non-convex polyhedral substructures arising in the cut generation problems for optimization under multivariate risk will be conducted. Third, two-stage optimization problems under multivariate risk will be formulated to allow recourse decisions. For these problems, decomposition algorithms that involve successive linear approximations of the second-stage problems will be devised.","02/28/2017","02/28/2017","1733001","Simge","Kucukyavuz","simge@uw.edu","02/28/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","006Y","OE Operations Engineering","072E","NETWORKS & QUEUING SYSTEMS","073E","OPTIMIZATION & DECISION MAKING","077E","SIMULATION MODELS","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These measurements of the longitudinal mechanical behavior of muscle have contributed to fundamental knowledge of muscle function at the tissue, cell, and molecular levels of organization. However the diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle, experiences a more complex mechanical environment in which applied forces can be resolved into longitudinal and transverse components. The potential physiological importance of mechanical loads applied to the transverse plane of the muscle in addition to mechanical forces along the length of muscle is suggested by the presence of similar populations of force-transmitting protein complexes at the lateral surface and at the ends of muscle fibers. The research will determine whether the diaphragm can detect and respond separately to longitudinal and transverse loading. This will increase our understanding of diaphragm function with age and disease. Undergraduate students also will receive research experiences form participating in the project.<br/><br/>MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of naturally occurring 22 nucleotides small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression either by degradation of target protein-coding mRNAs or by repressing translation in a mechanism similar to small interfering RNA mediated gene silencing. There is little known about the regulation of microRNAs in response to mechanical forces. Furthermore, it is not well understood how the complexity of in vivo mechanical loading in skeletal muscles such as the diaphragm alters the regulation of the microRNAs. It is also unknown whether specific cytoskeletal proteins such as desmin modulate the regulation of mechanosensing microRNAs in the ventilatory pump. The research will determine whether mechanosensing microRNAs such as let-7e-5p and miR-98-5p are regulated by two independent stretch induced signaling pathways that are dependent on the directions of applied mechanical stretch: along muscle fibers and transverse to muscle fibers.

A CISS is comprised of interdependent buildings that together serve a community function and that are dependent on networks of critical lifelines (water, wastewater, power, natural gas, communications and cyber-communications, and transportation). They are a family of structures that are linked by occupancy type, people, policies, information, geographic location, and/or building services, and thus also rely on human, organizational, political, and cyber links. Examples of a CISS structure include, but are not limited to, a school district, a healthcare delivery system, a government building, a university campus, a hospitality facility, a residential building, or a central business district. The project will focus on the impact of single or compound hazardous events on CISSs. The initial loss of a structure due to physical damage can spread throughout the CISS or its supporting lifelines. Subsequently, these interdependencies are dynamic and change over time through human intervention, emergent organizational behaviors, and policy changes. Finally, repairs and work-arounds can diminish the impact of the hazardous event(s). As a test, the resulting framework and specific techniques will be demonstrated on one type of CISS: a healthcare system. Insights gleaned from this test case can be applied to improve, build, and maintain communities that are more likely to withstand disruption or disaster. This effort will directly inform practicing healthcare managers and emergency planners. <br/><br/>The project will uniquely incorporate public policy, organizational policy, organizational behaviors and risk communication into a broader assessment of disaster resilience data of multiple hazards. An integrated approach will be used to describe the role of adaptation (organizational behaviors) and human interventions in interdependency dynamics. The project will seek to understand and model how organizational behaviors emerge and evolve during a disaster event. Moreover, it will study how cyber systems increase the impact of damage, resulting vulnerabilities to follow-on attacks, and approaches to prevent such escalation. Such approaches include risk communications strategies, using security systems and protocols, and taking other adaptive actions. How organizations work together to simulate and interpret reality, and how this can shift or change disaster response, will be studied. The impact of strategic communication on resilience will be measured. Analysis will require dynamic fault-tree and modeling of complex, adaptive systems with time-varying system states and changes. It will address the need for a computational framework for a large-scale model with significant dimensionality concerns. Additionally, educational and outreach tasks are aimed at strengthening the pipeline of women in STEM fields at multiple education and career stages by adopting a ""360"" mentorship philosophy that will foster training of female scientists of all ages to be high-caliber mentors.","03/01/2017","03/01/2017","1722658","Elise","Miller-Hooks","miller@gmu.edu","03/01/2017","Principal Investigator","George Mason University","FAIRFAX","220304422","7039932295","4400 UNIVERSITY DR","United States","Virginia","VA","1638","INFRAST MGMT & EXTREME EVENTS","1638","INFRAST MGMT & EXTREME EVENTS","7633","EFRI RESEARCH PROJECTS","8250","RIPS","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also aims to bolster the pipeline and build effective local networks through the pairing of high school teachers with these early career scientists. The workshop thus offers synergy by increasing the diversity of (1) scientists who are positioned to contribute both to IODP science and geoscience more broadly, and (2) mentors who research shows stand a better chance of positively influencing the educational and/or career pathways of undergraduate students of color (Kendricks, et al., 2013; Summers and Hrabowski, 2006). Direct scientific benefit will come from increasing diversity among the pool of young scientists that are broadly engaged in IODP science, allowing measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduates in STEM fields through programs such as STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS; Chang et al., 2014). This is a high priority for the NSF, UNOLS and other federally-funded programs.<br/><br/>This workshop focuses on an opportunity to entrain a diverse cohort of young scientists into the geoscience- and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP)- pipeline, and at the same time, to position these same individuals to have measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduate students from diverse communities nationwide through effective mentoring and engagement in critical issues of societal relevance.<br/>The overarching goals of the proposed workshop are to:<br/>1 - Encourage early career scientists and secondary-level educators from communities that remain poorly represented in STEM fields, and particularly geosciences, to participate.<br/>2 - Showcase and educate about Joides Resolution (JR)/IODP capabilities.<br/>3 - Increase the diversity of the talent pool that will apply to sail on IODP and related expeditions in the future.<br/>4 - Build a diverse mentoring pool for undergraduate STEM/geoscience students.<br/>5 - Create local partnerships to bolster the STEM/geoscience pipeline.","03/01/2017","03/01/2017","1734023","Jonathan","Lewis","jclewis@iup.edu","03/01/2017","Principal Investigator","Indiana University of Pennsylvania","Indiana","157051048","7243572244","Stright Hall, Room 129","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7699","ICER","7699","ICER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Steven","Hovan","hovan@iup.edu","03/01/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When species compete for the same resource the weaker competitor can be eliminated from the community. Nonetheless, there are many communities that contain competing species. One hypothesis is that competing species diverge so as to reduce competition, a phenomenon known as character displacement. This work focuses on closely related lizard species that have been introduced to southern Florida. Their recent co-occurrence provides an opportunity to study how species respond to novel competition, and what traits in each species diverge as a result. Observed shifts in both ecology and morphology may ultimately contribute to their long-term coexistence. The result of this study will be a better understanding of the role of character displacement in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. This project also creates a framework for teaching students and the public about the processes that enhance biodiversity. This framework will be implemented via an Ecology Club and an information webpage, as well as by engaging undergraduates in the research.<br/><br/>Populations of two non-native Anolis lizards, that have had no prior evolutionary interactions, will be studied to quantify the progression of character displacement. These species, the Cuban brown anole (Anolis sagrei) and the Puerto Rican crested anole (A. cristatellus), are ecologically and morphologically similar. Throughout Miami FL, they exist in multiple spatially-independent communities that consist of either both species (sympatric populations) or only one species (allopatric populations). These communities are analogous to the early stages of adaptive radiation, whereby ecomorphologically similar species that have speciated in allopatry come into contact and adaptively diverge as a result of interspecific competition. The project will investigate the ecological relationship between these two species to test the following hypotheses: (H1) In the presence of each other, both species will experience a divergence in resource use to minimize interspecific interactions. This hypothesis will be tested through detailed analyses of the ecology and behavior of both species across multiple replicates of both allopatric and sympatric populations. (H2) Divergence in resource use leads to changes in the phenotype of both species ? this is the process of character displacement. This hypothesis will be tested by detailed phenotypic assessments of both species across the populations. (H3) Shifts in phenotypic traits are heritable. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring trait heritability with laboratory breeding experiments. Taken together this case study will provide a more detailed understanding of the role of competition in evolutionary divergence.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1700505","Kenneth","Feeley","kfeeley@fiu.edu","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","Florida International University","Miami","331990001","3053482494","11200 SW 8TH ST","United States","Florida","FL","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"James","Stroud","jstro014@fiu.edu","03/02/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, we do not have a clear understanding of their history. Determining what led to this diversity will greatly help us understand how life has formed on our planet. It will also allow us to understand how future environmental perturbations might affect this diversity. Transitions to new habitat types, such as from freshwater to marine habitats, or tropical to temperate, may have increased fish diversity. Previous studies have examined the transition of fishes between these habitats and found varying amounts of support for the importance of each transition type. However, these transitions have only been examined in distantly related groups of fishes. This study will be the first to examine the evolutionary transitions between these habitats within a group of relatively closely related fish. These groups contain familiar and economically important species such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Outreach to the public and K-12 students will occur through presentations, social media, and museum displays.<br/><br/>This project will take a novel approach to answer two macro-evolutionary questions: How have diversification rates in the Centrarchiformes varied between (1) tropical and temperate habitats and (2) between freshwater and marine habitats? To answer these questions phylogenetic relationships among Centrarchiform species will be resolved using dense taxonomic sampling and thousands of unlinked nuclear loci. The phylogeny will be fossil calibrated and used in a variety of analyses to test for shifts in the diversification rate and their potential associations with salinity or thermal habitat transitions. Furthermore, this project may provide general insight on the diversification of other aquatic groups that span diverse habitat types.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1701323","Jacob","Esselstyn","esselstyn@lsu.edu","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College","Baton Rouge","708032701","2255782760","202 Himes Hall","United States","Louisiana","LA","1198","Biodiversity: Discov &Analysis","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"William","Ludt","wludt1@tigers.lsu.edu","03/02/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The investigators will develop computationally efficient algorithms for identifying genetic information from family data using a technique known as a Hidden Markov model. This model has demonstrated considerable success in a broad range of scientific disciplines, including areas such as speech recognition in telephone conversations and face identification from sequences of images. When the complexity of the problem increases, computational algorithms confront challenges with finding the solution of the model in realistic and practical time frames. The investigators' research on novel computational and statistical approaches will provide efficient algorithms, and software tools, of broad scientific relevance. In their work the tools developed will yield a more powerful approach for finding genes underlying complex diseases. The collaborative team will also directly apply their techniques to forestry genetic data describing a multi-year plant-breeding program. Educationally, the trainees involved will be integrated into a vibrant interdisciplinary research team, gaining exposure to techniques for the solution of real world problems. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional Markov processes are ubiquitous in the real world. Dependencies in interacting particle systems, images, videos, digitized documents, and gene transmission are all examples of multi-dimensional Markov processes. A Markov process is a random process (i.e., a statistical phenomenon in which the possible outcomes of a sequence of events or variables vary) in which the prediction of the future state is made just using the information of the current state, independent of both past history and unknown future states. This idea generalizes for higher dimensions. For example, gene transmission from parent to child is a two-dimensional Markov process, the determination of the future state, the child, depends on the neighbors in two dimensions, the parents. Most cases of interest, however, are hidden Markov processes, in which the current state of a variable cannot be observed, but must be inferred by consideration of all possible future states given all possible current states. As the number of quantities to be determined increases, the computational demand in both computer memory and computing time increases dramatically. To apply the concept, therefore, to many important real applications requires the development of novel and powerful computational algorithms. This project is focused on the design of a novel software package, specifically designed for the solution of hidden Markov models. The techniques developed will be relevant for the solution of problems from a broad array of disciplines, not only for wider family based genetic studies but also areas such as text analysis from images. Thus, this project will increase the computational ability to solve real-world problems across many engineering, geosciences and biological disciplines, with commensurate potential positive societal impact. In this case an interesting application arises in plant breeding through the collaboration with experts in forestry science.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1701433","Xiang-Yang","Lou","zjulxy219@yahoo.com","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","Arkansas Childrens Hospital Research Institute","Little Rock","722023510","5013643581","13 Children's way","United States","Arkansas","AR","8047","NIGMS","4075","NSF/NIGMS Initiative-Mathematical Bio","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scheiner","This project will study the process of adaptation to urban environments by the tropical lizard, Anolis cristatellus. Urbanization involves drastic habitat modifications that very frequently has negative effects on biodiversity, but a few plants and animals have the ability to persist and thrive. Understanding how these organisms are adapting to urbanization is therefore necessary for predicting future changes to the biosphere. Prior research has shown that Anolis cristatellus has adapted to urban environment through changes in its morphology and physiology. This project will identify genes associated with that adaptation. the result will be new insights into the genetic basis of rapid contemporary adaptation in this and other species and will inform conservation decisions in a world increasingly transformed by human activity. The project will also train undergraduate students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in the sciences, and will create a citizen science project to catalogue urban wildlife in Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>This research employs a genomic approach to identify previously unknown trait shifts related to urban adaptation. The project will use genomic techniques to target transcribed genes of lizards from urban and forest populations across its native range in Puerto Rico. Three common approaches to detect natural selection at the genetic level will be used: the measurement of between-population differentiation, the identification of selective sweeps, and the identification of gene regions with function-altering polymorphism. These methods will enable the identification of gene regions under selection, differential adaptive responses between urban and forest populations, and parallel adaptive responses between urban populations. In addition, the research will identify functional associations of gene regions under selection and will test for correlations between loci under selection and environmental differences between urban and natural habitats.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1701706","Liam","Revell","liam.revell@umb.edu","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Massachusetts Boston","Dorchester","021253300","6172875370","100 Morrissey Boulevard","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kristin","Winchell","kmwinchell@gmail.com","03/02/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood","Remote sensing is used to characterize and map the spatial variation of Earth's vegetation and its changes over time. A relatively new airborne laser sensor called LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) has been used to accurately characterize the three-dimensional vegetation structure and to measure plant biomass and carbon content. With increased LiDAR data availability, there is a need to develop open source tools for processing these data effectively to obtain the vegetation and terrain information. With current methods, substantial variation and uncertainty remain in estimating the amount and type of vegetation. Support from this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) will be used to develop open source tools to process LiDAR data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and to explore their potential for use in identifying tree species, estimating vegetation amounts, and determining the statistical uncertainty in the analysis. The methods developed from this project will facilitate the creation of 3D-vegetation structure and enable the understanding of ecosystem patterns and processes. The quantification of errors and uncertainties of vegetation structure and amount are also conducive to designing effective plans for sustainable forest management and providing accurate inputs for biogeochemical models to inform science-based policy.<br/><br/>This research will be accomplished through the following steps: (1) Develop algorithms and open source tools for LiDAR data processing, (2) Segment individual trees and identify tree species with raw LiDAR data alone using Random forests and Bayesian machine learning method, (3) Build different models (step-wise, Random forests, and hierarchical Bayesian models) to estimate forest biomass and carbon stocks using LiDAR metrics and variables derived from point clouds, and (4) Quantify the uncertainty of estimations in different processing stages based on different approaches and model parameters. The algorithms and processing methodologies developed in this proposal will provide open source tools for LiDAR waveform processing and enhance the use and value of NEON data. Moreover, the products of this research will assist forest managers to better manage precious natural resources and make more informed decisions.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1702008","Sorin","Popescu","s-popescu@tamu.edu","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M AgriLife Research","College Station","778453000","9794584383","2147 TAMU","United States","Texas","TX","7959","MACROSYSTEM BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tan","Zhou","tankwin0@tamu.edu","03/02/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The meeting will be held at West Dover, Vermont, August 5 to 11, 2017. The requested fund will be used for supporting students and postdocs who will attend the meetings. Particularly, the GRS is specifically aimed at young scientists. The meeting will be focused on the most recent scientific advances in optical diagnostics and their demonstrated or expected impact, in addition to diagnostic needs. Topics will include precise and accurate measurements of fluid motion and temperature, chemical composition, and transient and multi-phase phenomena under a wide range of conditions, including high pressure. The 2017 program also includes discussion of combustion diagnostics relevant to atmospheric emissions and impact of combustion on air quality and climate change.<br/><br/>Combustion is responsible for providing the majority of global energy needs but generating a large fraction of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Combustion processes are complex in that they involve multiphase, chemically reacting flows at high temperatures. Combustion diagnostics requires advanced instrumentation and scientific knowledge. This conference will bring together scientists and engineers with a strong interest in laser-based combustion diagnostics to discuss current approaches, latest developments, promising opportunities, and unaddressed needs for measurement techniques for probing combustion processes.

A key goal is to understand the role played by electron spin on the properties of the materials. Electron spin state is important as it relates to the interaction of molecules with light because it determines the efficiency in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and in solar cells. The effect of metals such as platinum, selenium, and tellurium on the electron spin is also being investigated. The project is being carried out by a team including undergraduate and graduate students with emphasis on participation by underrepresented groups. An international collaboration is included with a group at the King Abdulla University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. The project is expected to have broad impact because the organic semiconductors that are the focus of these studies are being used to develop plastic electronic materials used in flexible light emitting devices and displays, solar cells, sensors and radio frequency ID tags. Thus, the basic science being developed under this grant may have long term implications in technology development for the national health, defense and security sectors.<br/><br/>The project will initially involve the chemical synthesis of new semiconducting organic, organometallic and polymeric materials. Second, the properties of the new materials will be characterized by various techniques, including measurement of their light absorption and light emission characteristics. Specifically, pulsed laser techniques will used to understand the time evolution of the intermediate excited states that are formed upon light absorption by these new semiconducting materials. These experiments will be carried out on timescales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. The results will be interpreted within new or existing physical chemical models, enabling the assignment of the electronic spin state characteristics of these intermediates. This should permit the development of quantitative structure-property relationships which relate the molecular and polymer structure to how the systems interact with light energy. Computational chemistry will be used in specific cases to model the electronic structure of the materials, and this information will aid in the interpretation of the experimental results. Select materials are to be used in prototype device applications, including organic solar cells and field-effect transistor configurations, with the objective of relating the physical chemical information to material device performance. The results of the study are expected to enhance understanding of the optoelectronic properties of donor-acceptor conjugated systems, with a particular focus on the role played by triplet molecular excited states in such systems.","03/02/2017","03/02/2017","1737714","Kirk","Schanze","kschanze@chem.ufl.edu","03/02/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at San Antonio","San Antonio","782491644","2104584340","One UTSA Circle","United States","Texas","TX","6885","Macromolec/Supramolec/Nano","8396","Clean Energy Technology","8607","Solar Energy Capture&Conver",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood","Forests in the western US are facing warmer temperatures and larger, more severe wildfires than at any time in recorded history. Lodgepole pine forests of Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming) are well adapted to large, severe wildfires, which have burned at 100 to 300-yr intervals during the past 10,000 years. However, the interval between fires is shortening, making it likely that young forests will re-burn before fully recovering from previous fires. How forests will respond to more frequent fire and warmer, drier conditions is not known. Wildfires during summer 2016 burned young forests (less than 30 years old) that grew after the momentous 1988 Yellowstone Fires. These recent fires produced an unexpected opportunity to study the characteristics of short-interval fires and their effects on western pine forests. Sampling soon after severe fire is necessary because the time to find field evidence of burn severity is very short after the fire, and most tree seedlings establish during the first year after the fire. This RAPID award will measure burn severity, tree establishment and carbon storage in young forests that burned in 2016. Results will be immediately useful to regional forest managers, and mini-documentary videos will explain effects of increasing fire activity on western forests to a wide audience. Field data also will be used to improve computer models of forest growth and to assess burn-severity patterns across the US northern Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Field studies in areas burned in the 1988 fires that burned again in 2106 will test three hypotheses. (1) Short-interval fires will reduce forest resilience because burns will be of high severity, and post-fire conifer regeneration and carbon storage will be substantially reduced. (2) Post-fire climate will amplify consequences of short fire-return intervals such that post-fire conifer establishment will be substantially reduced (or fail) in re-burns where conditions are warm and dry. (3) Regionally, the proportion of high-severity fire will be greater in short-interval than long-interval fires, but landscape patterns of high-severity fire will be similar. Burn severity, tree regeneration and carbon storage will be measured during summer 2017 in 0.25-ha plots following standard protocols. A seed addition experiment will be conducted to separate effects of seed supply from post-fire climate conditions on tree seedling establishment.

But fires can also have an important influence the amount, kinds, and transport of organic matter that is in forest soil, with potentially large ramifications for forest productivity. However, studying the effects of wildfire is very difficult due to the rapid post-fire changes to the environment and often the lack of robust pre-fire data in locations that have recently burned. This project will take advantage of data on soil organic carbon collected prior to and immediately after the recent fire in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to examine immediate post-fire effects on organic carbon cycling across the terrestrial-aquatic interface. The fire burned two sites with the park that are part of the National Ecological Observatory Network so it will be possible to couple a detailed pre-fire assessment of soil carbon with post-fire changes in the same locations. In doing so, this project will fill in gaps in our understanding of how fire affects forest ecosystems in the Eastern United States.<br/><br/>Fire introduces a spectrum of thermally-altered carbon (C) such as black C (condensed-aromatic residue produced from incomplete combustion of organic matter), poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) to terrestrial, atmospheric, and aquatic systems. This thermally-altered material can have important effects on quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) as well as terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem function. The effects of fire on soil stocks and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are poorly understood, however many streams have higher DOM concentrations post-fire, suggesting that soil concentrations of DOM increase and are mobile within the soil profile. Several pathways are available to this highly labile, hydrophilic DOC, including: (1) efficient transport to a stream where it may become an important source of carbon to aquatic organisms; and (2) efficient transport to deeper parts of the soil profile where naked mineral surfaces dominate and the sorptive capacity is highest and therefore this material can be sequestered as deep soil carbon. The partitioning of DOC between these pathways has important implications for predicting the impacts of fire on ecosystem function and services including, drinking water quality and soil carbon sequestration. The process of post-fire incorporation of these solid residues can be quite rapid but remains poorly understood.

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Synthetic chemists have long striven to mimic nature's ability to construct large and complex aggregates and molecular machinery that perform critical functions in the body by spontaneous association of small, well-defined building blocks such as proteins. Inspired by this biological analogy, this research project aims to develop a new class of fully synthetic polymer molecules with brush-like architecture that provides three-dimensional control over the shape of the molecules and their interactions to guide the biomimetic molecular organization. Such highly tunable molecular building blocks will be prepared by newly developed synthetic chemistry methods and studied by a variety of techniques for the formation of advanced materials. These materials will be relevant to water filtration membranes, uniform biomimetic vesicles, and lightweight nanocomposites, for a variety of energy and health related applications. The planned research activities will advance the current understanding of molecular assembly, allow for unprecedented levels of biomimicry, and offer potentially new avenues for the fabrication of high-value nanomaterials. The scientific aspects of the proposed research program will be integrated with broader outreach and educational initiatives aimed at improving science/technology/engineering/mathematics (STEM) education and developing a competitive STEM workforce through teacher professional development and graduate and undergraduate student training.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The research to be conducted under this project aims to develop new modes of polymer assembly directed by molecular architecture. Comb-like macromolecules with a persistent shape and spatial control over compositional profile and intermolecular interactions will be developed by introducing three new structural motifs: bottlebrush architecture with a gradient compositional taper along the backbone, quadruple hydrogen bonding functionalities on bottlebrush periphery, and highly associating polyimide brushes. A combination of different intermolecular interactions spatially guided by the bottlebrush architecture will be used to drive the assembly of polymeric building blocks into highly ordered nanomaterials. Three specific objectives will be pursued: (1) synthesis and melt self-assembly of gradient bottlebrush copolymers, (2) programmed biomimetic assembly of amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers with strategically directed hydrogen bonding interactions into highly uniform porous aggregates, and (3) synthesis of polyimide nanoparticles and nanofibers by controlled anisotropic aggregation of core-shell bottlebrush copolymers. The successful outcome of this research program will provide access to a new molecular architecture, design principles to control the directionality of intermolecular interactions and molecular orientation within the self-assembled nanostructures, and the potential fabrication of previously unattainable materials with a wide range of properties and applications.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1709371","Javid","Rzayev","jrzayev@buffalo.edu","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator","SUNY at Buffalo","Amherst","142282567","7166452634","520 Lee Entrance","United States","New York","NY","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8037","Advanced Manufacturing","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Numerous applications have been found for flexible hybrid electronics, including human performance monitoring, wearable medical sensors, information storage, and soft robotics. An indispensable component for flexible electronics is the printable dielectric layer, which regulates the electric current in the semiconductor. In response to this demand, this project is aimed at the design and development of novel printable high-performance dielectric polymers. In this project, a polymer theoretician will use advanced computer simulation to design and predict the dielectric properties for these new materials. A polymer chemist will synthesize the designed dielectric polymers, whose various properties and performance will be characterized by a polymer physicist (who will also be coordinating the research). A close loop among theoretical prediction, chemical synthesis, and polymer characterization will be built in the project to accelerate the progress. If successful, not only will our knowledge on polymer dielectric phenomena be advanced, but also new printable dielectric materials could ensue for future flexible electronics and energy-related applications. In addition to its industrial relevance, this project will also provide a comprehensive platform for education and outreach on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The project is aimed to include undergraduates and high-school students in research and to enhance diversity. It will also benefit an undergraduate/graduate course on Advanced Polymer Engineering which will include electrical properties of polymers for practical applications. Students will be encouraged to present their findings at local and major national meetings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>A high-performance printable gate dielectric is an important component for future flexible field-effect transistors (FETs). To enhance the performance, past research has focused on decreasing the thickness of the gate dielectric, e.g., via self-assembled monolayers. Although high capacitance density can be achieved using ultrathin dielectrics, manufacturability has been challenging due to the susceptibility of ultrathin films to intrinsic defects, such as pinholes and grain boundaries. To circumvent this manufacturing challenge, the dielectric constant of printable gate dielectrics has to be substantially increased while keeping the dielectric loss low. In addition, gate dielectrics should have good mechanical stability and good response to external fields in a wide range of frequencies. To realize reliable printable/flexible FETs, this project aims to design and develop novel high-dielectric-constant and low-loss dipolar glass polymers with intrinsic microporosity (DG-PIMs). First, theoretical analysis and computer simulation using mixed full atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics will guide the design and synthesis of DG-PIMs. Post-modifications will be employed to convert conventional PIMs into novel DG polymers. Both structural and dielectric properties will be characterized, and computer simulation studies will be refined on the basis of the experimental results. Through this cycle of computer simulation, polymer synthesis, structure/property characterization, and feedback, enhanced orientational polarization in the proposed DG-PIMs will be fully explored and improved new materials produced.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1708990","Philip","Taylor","plt@case.edu","03/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Case Western Reserve University","CLEVELAND","441064901","2163684510","Nord Hall, Suite 615","United States","Ohio","OH","1773","POLYMERS","054Z","(MGI) Materials Genome Initiative","8037","Advanced Manufacturing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lei","Zhu","lei.zhu2@case.edu","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sustaining the rapid growth in these technologies is essential to maintaining the nation's leadership and economic competitiveness. In July 2016, the National Science Foundation announced a multi-year effort, called Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR), aimed at creating a set of city-scale testbeds to promote research in advanced wireless communication and networking technologies over the next decade. In this effort, the NSF was joined by a Consortium of companies with commercial interests in the wireless technologies resulting from this investment. PAWR will enable experimental exploration of robust new wireless devices, communication techniques, networks, systems, and services that will revolutionize the nation's wireless ecosystem, thereby enhancing broadband connectivity, leveraging the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and sustaining US leadership and economic competitiveness for decades to come. PAWR will also enable rapid commercialization of promising technologies, bringing jobs and economic vitality. Researchers will have access to realistic, city-scale testbeds for testing new wireless theories and concepts, while a whole new generation of participating graduate students will emerge with hands-on practical training.<br/><br/>In order to support the design, development, deployment, and operations of the advanced wireless research platforms, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) is funding this award, which will support the work of a PAWR Project Office (PPO). Working closely with the wireless research community, the PPO will assume responsibility for design, development, and deployment of a set of advanced wireless research platforms. Upon successful completion of the design of advanced wireless research platforms, the PPO will proceed to the development and deployment phases with funding provided by NSF as well as the Industry Consortium. The PPO will professionally establish and manage the advanced Research Platforms needed to unleash American innovation, drive economic development, and help extend US global leadership in the wireless industry. The PPO will work closely with the wireless research community in all aspects of the design, development, deployment, and operations of PAWR. A PAWR Steering Council (PSC), comprising research leaders in wireless networking technologies and a subset of the Industry Consortium, will represent the community's research interests in PAWR. The PSC will be chartered and supported by the PPO, with the goal of obtaining advice on all aspects of the deployment and operations of the advanced wireless research platforms.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1719547","Joseph","Kochan","joe.kochan@us-ignite.org","03/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","US Ignite, Inc.","Washington","200363846","2023659219","1150 18th Street NW, Suite 900","United States","District of Columbia","DC","2890","CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES","044Z","PAWR- Platforms for Advanced Wireless Re","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bryan","Mikesh","bryan.mikesh@us-ignite.org","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"William","Wallace","william.wallace@us-ignite.org","03/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The methods developed in this project will be useful in a wide variety of applications of national importance such as disaster management, border surveillance, monitoring of civilian infrastructure including oil pipelines, power grids, harbors, inland waterways, and intelligent transportation systems where GPS signals can be easily jammed either intentionally or unintentionally. The proposed research spans several areas including control, estimation, sensing, robotics and optimization. This project provides a rich opportunity for involving undergraduate and graduate students in the development of vehicle platforms, sensor networks, and in the implementation of the control and optimization algorithms. This project engages minority students in small research projects to motivate their interest in engineering and science. Enabling autonomous unmanned vehicles with a capability of navigating in GPS denied environments can aid in effectively monitoring large infrastructure systems, protect their structural integrity and functional reliability as well as provide ecological, societal and economic benefits, including better preservation of natural resources, reduced property damage and reduced loss of life.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses the following fundamental problem that arises while deploying unmanned vehicles in GPS-denied environments: Given a set of vehicles and targets to visit, find a path for each vehicle such that each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, the error in the position estimate of each vehicle at any time instant is within a given bound and an objective which depends on the travel and sensing costs is minimized. The specific technical objectives of this project are to: determine the minimal set of requirements that would render the system of vehicles observable over a time period, develop novel approximation and exact algorithms using cutting plane, rounding and Lagrangian dual methods for the optimization problems, and experimentally corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithms using large scale and hardware-in-the-loop simulations, and field demonstrations. It is anticipated that this project will significantly advance the state of art in the area of observability analysis for a team of cooperatively localizing vehicles, and in the area of tractable, approximation and exact algorithms for vehicle placement and path planning problems with resource and localization constraints. Novel cutting plane, rounding, and Lagrangian dual methods are expected to provide new insights into efficient ways of decomposing the difficulties in the vehicle placement and path planning problems, and will lead to good feasible solutions with approximation bounds. The proposed large scale simulation and experimental results will provide a new understanding of the influence of the different parameters (number of landmarks/vehicles/targets, bounds on acceptable position errors, onboard sensor type, different operational environments, and the speed of each vehicle) on the performance of the vehicle localization/path planning system.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1736087","Rajnikant","Sharma","rajnikant.sharma@uc.edu","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Cincinnati Main Campus","Cincinnati","452210222","5135564358","University Hall, Suite 530","United States","Ohio","OH","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7923","SMALL PROJECT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Complex high-level program transformations are required to address this problem, to map the proper grain of independent computation and the proper data locality to a complex hierarchy of memory, computing and interconnection resources. The polyhedral compilation framework is one of the most powerful and flexible loop transformation system, with numerous compelling results achieved in recent years in terms of automatic program optimization (CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs). But a difficult challenge remains the deployment of those research results to larger-scale programs. Indeed, this framework uses complex mathematical algorithms that are the reason for the better program performance achieved, but which are often too time consuming for production use.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of polyhedral optimizations, through the design of exact optimization methods and their associated approximation heuristics for increased scalability. We will develop novel program transformation algorithms operating under hardware resources constraints, for a variety of devices currently available on heterogeneous computing systems: for multi-core CPUs using short-vector SIMD units; for FPGAs with the help of high-level synthesis tool-chain; and for GPUs.

The project includes foundational problems in combinatorics where randomization plays a crucial role. Further development of the existing tools as well as invention of new tools and techniques will be used to solve those problems, and to investigate both practical and theoretic applications. Plans to disseminate the new discoveries at major international conferences of experts are included as part of the project.<br/><br/>The probabilistic method has become a cornerstone of research in modern combinatorics. This project studies the main open problems and applications, including the Kahn-Kallai conjecture and related problems regarding the threshold behavior of graph properties in random graphs. The aim is to find threshold functions for the appearance of large graphs in a random graph, to prove universality-type results, and to develop general tools for embedding general graphs into arbitrary graphs and digraphs satisfying some given desired pseudorandom properties. Another salient part of the project is the broad topic of packing problems, which concerns partitioning combinatorial objects into members from a specified family of objects. The study of the classical tree-packing conjecture and related problems has led to the development of new embedding techniques which can be useful in different areas and form a central part of the project. The project also considers the broad topic of random sums, which is known as the Littlewood-Offord problem. Motivated by a central problem in the theory of random matrices, resilience-type versions of these question and also working with sums of dependent random variables are considered, with potential impact on error-correcting codes and cryptography.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1700338","Asaf","Ferber","ferbera@MIT.EDU","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Cambridge","021394301","6172531000","77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding subglacial hydrology, the persistence of life in extended isolation and the evolution and stability of subglacial habitats requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach. The collaborative project, Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration (MIDGE) of the Biogeochemistry, Hydrology and Glaciology of Blood Falls, McMurdo Dry Valleys will integrate geophysical measurements, molecular microbial ecology and geochemical analyses to explore a unique Antarctic subglacial system known as Blood Falls. Blood Falls is a hypersaline, subglacial brine that supports an active microbial community. The subglacial brine is released from a crevasse at the surface of the Taylor Glacier providing an accessible portal into an Antarctic subglacial ecosystem. Recent geochemical and molecular analyses support a marine source for the salts and microorganisms in Blood Falls. The last time marine waters inundated this part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys was during the Late Tertiary, which suggests the brine is ancient. Still, no direct samples have been collected from the subglacial source to Blood Falls and little is known about the origin of this brine or the amount of time it has been sealed below Taylor Glacier. Radar profiles collected near Blood Falls delineate a possible fault in the subglacial substrate that may help explain the localized and episodic nature of brine release. However it remains unclear what triggers the episodic release of brine exclusively at the Blood Falls crevasse or the extent to which the brine is altered as it makes its way to the surface. <br/><br/>The MIDGE project aims to determine the mechanism of brine release at Blood Falls, evaluate changes in the geochemistry and the microbial community within the englacial conduit and assess if Blood Falls waters have a distinct impact on the thermal and stress state of Taylor Glacier, one of the most studied polar glaciers in Antarctica. The geophysical study of the glaciological structure and mechanism of brine release will use GPR, GPS, and a small passive seismic network. Together with international collaborators, the 'Ice Mole' team from FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Germany (funded by the German Aerospace Center, DLR), MIDGE will develop and deploy innovative, minimally invasive technologies for clean access and brine sample retrieval from deep within the Blood Falls drainage system. These technologies will allow for the collection of samples of the brine away from the surface (up to tens of meters) for geochemical analyses and microbial structure-function experiments. There is concern over the contamination of pristine subglacial environments from chemical and biological materials inherent in the drilling process; and MIDGE will provide data on the efficacy of thermoelectric probes for clean access and retrieval of representative subglacial samples. Antarctic subglacial environments provide an excellent opportunity for researching survivability and adaptability of microbial life and are potential terrestrial analogues for life habitats on icy planetary bodies. The MIDGE project offers a portable, versatile, clean alternative to hot water and mechanical drilling and will enable the exploration of subglacial hydrology and ecosystem function while making significant progress towards developing technologies for minimally invasive and clean sampling of icy systems.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1727387","Jill","Mikucki","jmikucki@utk.edu","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","5292","ANTARCTIC INTEGRATED SYS SCI","8013","High Risk/Reward Innovative Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9150",NA,NA,NA,"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elekonich","Who we are- our behavior, physiology, and health throughout our lives- is strongly influenced by our early life. Decades of experimental research in animal taxa and epidemiological studies of humans have demonstrated that nutrition in the womb and behavioral care after birth are instrumental for the developing young. Mother's milk sustains infant growth, development, and behavioral activity, but little is known about the effects of milk on offspring brain and behavior, especially after weaning during adolescence and adulthood. Importantly, mother's milk is food, medicine, and hormonal signal. This project will investigate how mother's milk ingested in infancy influences neurobiology and social behavior in adolescence and adulthood by programming behavior during early life. Longitudinal, interdisciplinary research on how mother's milk shapes offspring, not only addresses key theoretical questions in animal behavior, but has important implications for infant nutrition, clinical recommendations, and human well-being. Such knowledge will inform maternal decisions about breast-feeding initiation and duration, improve replacement and supplemental formula compositions, influence clinical interventions during early life, and can shape institutional policy (e.g. parental leave). Researchers in the Comparative Lactation Lab create research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees, particularly through minority tracks of the PRISE (Program for Research in Science & Engineering) and HGWISE (Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering). The results will be communicated to the general public through ""Mammals Suck... Milk!"" a blog written accessibly for clinical and lay audiences, as well as science outreach lectures in K-12 classrooms, natural history museums, and science centers. <br/><br/>The study will address two key questions in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta): 1) How does early life nutrition and hormonal signaling via mother's milk affect social behavior, particularly social networks, mating, and maternal behavior during transitions from adolescence to adulthood and 2) How are these behavioral effects mediated through the organization of temperament and neurobiology during infancy. Neurobiological (PET and MRI) and behavioral investigations of lactocrine programming, both nutritional and hormonal, are needed in long-lived, socially-complex, singleton-rearing taxa. This project provides an unparalleled and ephemeral opportunity to prospectively assess neurobiological and behavioral outcomes in a targeted cohort of adolescent and adult rhesus monkeys that were intensively studied as infants, including systematic analysis of the milk their mothers produced. Longitudinal integration of early life experiences with neurobiology, behavioral phenotype, and fitness outcomes addresses fundamental aspects of maternal effects and developmental programming and advances an understanding of how selection has shaped maternal investment strategies and consequences for offspring. Results generated from the proposed research will be disseminated to the scholarly and clinical community via open access publication and data will be made searchable, available, and citable through the online Dryad Data Repository.","03/06/2017","03/06/2017","1724803","Katherine","Hinde","Katie.Hinde@asu.edu","03/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Principal Investigators supported with ECR funding will attend a 2-day meeting where they will share their own work, but also hear from luminaries in the field on the broad issues converging across the research areas supported by ECR. The goals of the convening are to engage interdisciplinary leaders around the findings of their research, identify big issues related to fundamental research in STEM education, solicit PI feedback on opportunities and barriers to rapid advancement within the ECR research community, and help shape the field's future research and development efforts. The meeting will strengthen and deepen understanding of project activities and results, the challenges encountered by PIs conducting fundamental research, and the foundational knowledge that has been developed and accumulated by these projects. Additionally, the meeting will increase the PIs' knowledge of the wide range of research topics in STEM education that are addressed by the ECR program, and identify opportunities and gaps in the research.<br/><br/>The approach to planning and executing the convening will include appointing program committee members, identifying session formats, coordinating participation of keynote speakers and panelists, developing a web site to support the event, facilitating and participating in sessions at the event, writing a report based on the content of the event, and promoting and disseminating information after the event (e.g., press releases, blogs, and social media). During the planning process, the team will actively seek input from potential attendees. They will use the input to focus the convening on what matters most to attendees. They will broadly disseminate the resources produced by the event and a final report on the convening's outcomes through social media channels, newsletters, and other connections we have throughout the research community, including through resource centers supported by NSF. The online resources will be open, broadly advertised, and permanently available. Additional stakeholders, practitioners, and policymakers will be invited as panelists and keynote speakers to help encourage discussions toward broader impacts aligned with overall ECR goals.","03/07/2017","03/07/2017","1713000","Jeremy","Roschelle","jeremy.roschelle@sri.com","03/07/2017","Principal Investigator","SRI International","Menlo Park","940253493","6508592651","333 RAVENSWOOD AVE","United States","California","CA","7980","Core R&D Programs","1544","GSE: Research on Gender in S&E","1545","RES IN DISABILITIES ED","8212","Broaden Particip STEM Resrch","8816","Workforce Development","8817","STEM Learning & Learning Environments","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","Sarita","Nair-Pillai","spillai@edc.org","03/07/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shari","Gardner","shari.gardner@sri.com","03/07/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is a growing field whose beginnings were prompted by the dawn of the computer age. Its practitioners have the same goals as the invariant theorists of the 19th century. The emphasis is on constructions and algorithms. At the start of the 20th century Hilbert showed how much easier it is to prove the existence of a mathematical object than to construct it. At the time when all constructions had to be done by hand it was very alluring to abandon constructions. Abstract mathematics flourished with powerful new results and methods to the present date. Computers combined with emergence of powerful symbolic software brought back interest and ability to construct. The power of combinatorial constructs emerged at the same time to create a field of growing promise. What is a combinatorial construct? The answer is simple: it is a visual realization of a mathematical construct. The old saying ""A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words"" cannot be more appropriate in this case. When we translate a mathematical construct into a single visual image a variety of properties of the construct emerge that were not as evident in the original purely mathematical formulation. We must see to believe how these properties predict identities relating some of the most abstruse mathematical constructs. The interplay between algebra and combinatorics is at the heart of the research activities supported by this award. <br/><br/><br/>Research of the last two decades has shown in a unequivocal way that symmetric function theory is a powerful computational tool not only for theoretical investigations also but for obtaining computer data in various branches of mathematics. Therefore the most significant by-products of the planed research are new symmetric function tools and identities. Early computer explorations by the principal investigator and Haiman yielded data which revealed a surprisingly intimate connection between the space of Diagonal Harmonics, Parking Functions, and the Theory of Macdonald polynomials. This development produced a variety of problems and conjectures some of which are still open. Parallel to this development the researchers in the Theory of Torus Knots obtained symmetric function constructs identical to those derived in our field using Parking Functions. The proposed work aims to exploit this connection. The resulting discoveries can positively affect areas that have been connected with the present field: Representation Theory, Symmetric Function Theory, Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry, and Computational Algebra. Algebraic Combinatorics is particularly suitable for computer experimentation.

One of the most defining characteristics for the human species and the other primates is large brain size relative to body size. Yet, despite having larger brains than most other mammals, human and nonhuman primates do not show an increase in their basal metabolic rate (a measure of energy utilization by the body) compared to other mammals, raising the question of how the high energetic cost of such large brains is met. This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another energy-demanding tissue in the body when brain size increases; if we are not using more energy overall, then energy that could be invested in another part of our body is instead likely being utilized to fuel our large brains. Preliminary research shows that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals, and humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size, show a 50% reduction in overall muscle mass when compared with other mammals. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is in direct competition with the brain for glucose and oxygen, such that the high energetic demands of large brain size are met through constraining muscle mass, constituting an energetic tradeoff between skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, and brain growth and maintenance. <br/><br/>If the brain does constrain muscle mass, then 1)larger brains should be associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass; 2)the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) should show a relative decrease in relation to larger brain size; and 3)muscle mass development should be suppressed until brain growth is complete, and once complete, there should be an increase in muscle mass development. To test these predictions, muscle tissue samples will be collected from a diverse array of primate specimens, comprising a range of brain sizes and representing all developmental stages. The generated muscle energy use profiles for each species will then be analyzed in relation to variation in brain size, with the results applied to understanding the interaction between brain size and evolved metabolic strategies. <br/><br/>Reducing muscle mass may have predisposed primates such as humans to certain metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes); thus, understanding if there is such a constraint has important health implications. Ultimately, the data collected can be incorporated into studies of growth and development, as well as biomechanics, and the results may encourage development of biomedical gene therapies. The research also will provide a rich database for scientists in other disciplines focusing on animal anatomy and physiology, facilitating and expanding future research. The collaborative project brings together international researchers, and will support the training of multiple undergraduate and graduate students from three US universities. As two of these universities are in EPSCoR states, and one is a historically minority-serving institution, the project will foster research advancement for underserved and underrepresented populations.","03/08/2017","03/08/2017","1734668","Magdalena","Muchlinski","magdalena.muchlinski@unthsc.edu","03/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth","Fort Worth","761072699","8177355073","3500 Camp Bowie Blvd.","United States","Texas","TX","1392","Biological Anthropology","1392","Biological Anthropology","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","1397","CROSS-DIRECTORATE ACTIV PROGR","8089","Understanding the Brain/Cognitive Scienc","8091","BRAIN Initiative Res Support",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1397",NA,NA,NA,"CROSS-DIRECTORATE ACTIV PROGR",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Object recognition is typically performed by fitting a function that maps an image to likely object locations and labels. Such a function is fitted (trained) on a database of example images along with their human-assigned object locations and labels. This research can result in more accurate visual perception for socially relevant applications, such as robots performing household tasks, assisting the elderly, responding to disasters and quickly learning new manufacturing and service skills. It can also provide a common codebase for the wider community, new dataset challenges for domain adaptation problems, the dissemination of scientific and technical results and associated courseware, and specific outreach to ensure broad participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The specific research agenda is structured around two aims. The first aim is to establish bounds on the coverage of latent physical factors in datasets needed for human-level performance on arbitrary domains. The study involves both existing datasets and new datasets generated using graphics rendering techniques at various degrees of photorealism. The goal is to develop a theory of the physical complexity of a given dataset and how it affects generalization to real world object recognition tasks, with respect to a given image representation and learning framework. Physical parameters include but are not limited to: 3D shape, surface color, texture, background/scene, camera viewpoint, sensor noise, lighting, specularities and cast shadows. The second research aim is to learn image representations invariant to some of the physical causes of data bias. The goal is to develop model and representation learning methods that are able to learn from a combination of real and non-photorealistic synthetic data, and are resistant to common sources of data bias. The representations include simple edge-based descriptors, and more generally hierarchical representations based on layers of convolution and pooling operations.","03/08/2017","03/08/2017","1738063","Kate","Saenko","saenko@bu.edu","03/08/2017","Principal Investigator","Trustees of Boston University","BOSTON","022151300","6173534365","881 COMMONWEALTH AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By taking advantage of advances in microbial ecology and natural light fluctuations over the course of the day, the algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal process can provide complete nitrogen removal with very low chemical and energy inputs. The technology will potentially reduce nutrient pollutant discharges to the environment, allowing wastewater facilities to economically comply with existing and future environmental regulations. Application of this technology will help reduce eutrophication (overgrowth of algae) of surface waters and nitrate contamination of groundwater.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will focus on customer discovery to investigate how the innovative algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal technology can be potentially integrated into existing wastewater treatment processes. High ammonia strength wastewaters are challenging and costly to treat in conventional biological nitrogen removal systems due to their toxicity and high aeration and chemical requirements. Laboratory research has demonstrated that complete ammonium removal can be achieved in a sequencing batch photoreactor with alternating light and dark periods (day and night). During the light period, oxygen produced through photosynthesis stimulates nitrite production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. During the dark period, dissolved oxygen is quickly consumed, promoting nitrogen removal from the wastewater. This innovative technology can be applied to the treatment of domestic wastewater sidestreams and agricultural wastewater to reduce the costs, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions associated with nitrogen removal from wastewaters.","03/08/2017","03/08/2017","1730586","Sarina","Ergas","sergas@eng.usf.edu","03/08/2017","Principal Investigator","University of South Florida","Tampa","336129446","8139742897","3702 Spectrum Blvd.","United States","Florida","FL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project explores a new approach to synthesize heterostructures made of sheets of two-dimensional materials, in which atoms within a sheet form strong bonds but interactions between the layers are very weak. Atomic-resolution imaging and calculations are carried out to understand how this characteristic anisotropic bonding facilitates the growth and assembling of the single atomic layers similar to LEGO blocks, thus allowing the design and synthesis of new materials with tailored properties and functionalities beyond the limits of materials that currently exist in nature. This project provides graduate and undergraduate students interdisciplinary training in areas of materials synthesis and characterization at the atomic scale, as well as electronic structure calculations. The open source distribution of electronic structure codes continues to provide the scientific community the benefits of our team's code development efforts. An ongoing Research Experience for Teachers outreach program brings cutting-edge research on two-dimensional materials to high-school students to inspire their interest in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>This project aims to gain an atomic scale understanding of 1) the inherent grain boundary formation during the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxial growth of two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, and 2) the doping and bandgap engineering of their heterostructures. Leveraging the capability of integrating molecular beam epitaxy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), the intrinsic materials properties such as band offsets across lateral junctions and work functions are determined by in-situ tunneling spectroscopy and force-bias spectroscopy, respectively. Layer thickness, doping, and band gaps are further accessed by ex-situ Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The information obtained by these spatially averaged spectroscopic measurements is correlated with atomic scale structural information such as the alignment of vertical junctions, interface intermixing, local strain, and disorder obtained by in-situ atomic resolution STM/AFM imaging, as well as ex-situ transmission electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations are tightly coupled to the experimental systems of interest, addressing issues related to structural properties (e.g., energetics of the modified vdW growth and the impact of defects and impurities) and electronic properties (interface states, band offsets, charging effects at grain boundaries, and work functions). This integrated approach enables the controlled growth, bandgap engineering, and characterization of heterostructures of monolayers at the atomic scale, all necessary steps towards tailoring their electronic and optical properties.","03/09/2017","03/09/2017","1734017","Lian","Li","lian.li@mail.wvu.edu","03/09/2017","Principal Investigator","West Virginia University Research Corporation","Morgantown","265066845","3042933998","P.O.

However, modern crocodylians are more diverse than often appreciated and their skulls, in particular, can range from short and wide to incredibly long and slender. Prior research has shown that crocodylian skull shape is correlated with dietary and habitat specializations, but it remains unclear how these shapes come to be. The formation of crocodylian skull diversity is tied to development: the changes that occur in an individual as it grows from a fertilized egg to an adult. The process of development is controlled by genes, and changes to how genes are expressed can modify developmental pathways and adult anatomy. By combining data from fossils, crocodylian embryos, and modern developmental biology techniques, this project will reveal which changes in developmental pathways were key to the evolution of the crocodylian skull, and the evolutionary diversity of crocodylians. Insights from this research may also inform general connections between genomic, developmental and organismal complexity in vertebrates. To capitalize on the public interest in crocodiles and their relatives (dinosaurs and birds), this project will develop K-12 activities for students and teachers in conjunction with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). These activities explore key concepts in paleontology and developmental biology and will be tied to the Next Generation Science Standards. The HMNH provides a unique venue to reach a diverse urban audience from across the Boston Metropolitan area and visitors from around the world.<br/><br/> Unique morphological features distinguish major groups of animals like crocodylians, mammals, and birds. These features are important for the particular lifestyles and habits of these groups and have been critical for their survival over millions of years. The formation of this diversity is caused by the evolution of novel genes, novel functions for genes, or modification to the developmental pattern of gene expression. Integrating fossils, embryos, and developmental genetic techniques, this study will reveal developmental mechanisms involved in the evolution of crocodylian cranial diversity. This project will study the expression patterns of key genes involved in the development of the skull in extant crocodylians using in situ hybridization. Developmental stages from eight target species, which broadly sample the phylogeny and diversity of snout shapes in modern crocodylians, will be analyzed. The project aims to experimentally replicate ancestral and derived gene expression patterns and to use geometric morphometrics to quantify the relationship between expression patterns and skull shapes.

Interfaces are ubiquitous and important in many natural phenomena, such as materials fracture and deformation, and consequently play important roles in many areas of science and technology. The goal of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of interface thermodynamics and investigate the effects of temperature, chemical composition, interface curvature and other factors on interface properties.<br/><br/>Four research directions will be pursued in this project: (1) investigation of structural phase transformations in metallic grain boundaries (GBs), including the construction of GB phase diagrams; (2) investigation of structure and properties of alloy GBs at high temperatures approaching the melting point; (3) analysis of equilibrium thermal fluctuations of interface properties and development of efficient methods for computational prediction of such properties; and (4) development of thermodynamics of strongly curved interfaces, including extensions of the existing theory to non-spherical interfaces and incorporation of quadratic and higher-order effects in curvature. The atomistic simulations will utilize molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and other techniques.<br/><br/>The research will provide a theoretical framework for the development of new models of phase and interface stability, phase nucleation, and other interface-controlled processes. The project will lead to a better fundamental understanding of interface thermodynamics and will provide new capabilities for its computational prediction. The improved understanding of interface thermodynamics will enhance our ability to control precipitation and coarsening in structural materials such as superalloys, solidification microstructures in cast alloys, nanowire growth, and reactive wetting.<br/><br/>The project is expected to have impact on several areas of materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.

However, the theory fails to account for critically important characteristics of muscle function. Despite decades of work, a predictive model of muscle force during natural movements remains elusive. The researchers will test the hypothesis that important properties of muscle can be explained by the winding filament hypothesis. The proposed work has significant potential to inform our understanding of how neural activation and applied forces together determine in vivo muscle force. Results from the research will be integrated into graduate and/or undergraduate courses at Denison University (RUI-eligible), Northwestern University, and Northern Arizona University. In addition, the research team will leverage programs at Denison University and Northern Arizona University for recruiting under-represented participants in research. Results will be disseminated to broad audiences through standard mechanisms of publication and diverse public media, as well as participation in interdisciplinary conferences in the areas of engineering, biomechanics, and physiology.<br/><br/>The researchers will use the mdm mouse to test predictions of the winding filament hypothesis. The winding hypothesis claims that, in addition to the thin filaments, titin is activated by Ca2+, and that cross-bridges not only translate but also rotate the thin filaments, storing elastic energy in PEVK titin during isometric force development. Due to constraints of sarcomere geometry on titin activation and winding, the hypothesis makes unique quantitative predictions about the effects of stimulation and length changes on muscle force. By including different muscles in the proposed studies, the researchers can determine whether naturally occurring variation in titin structure and function contributes to activation- and length-dependent muscle properties (e.g., doublet potentiation and force depression/enhancement). The experiments will test whether titin activation and winding, alone or in combination, can account for observed muscle forces by comparing experimental results to model predictions.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1731917","Jenna","Monroy","monroyj@denison.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Claremont McKenna College","Claremont","917115929","9096218117","500 E.

The results will provide general insights into the processes by which complex traits evolve. Organisms exhibit many complex and interrelated traits that contribute to their success in the environment. However, the evolution of complexity is poorly understood. Investigating the molecular and genetic mechanisms that produce complex traits clarify the origins of biological complexity. This project will explore these mechanisms in the expression of seasonal coat color change in snowshoe hares, which exhibit regional variation in their ability to change color. The project will involve undergraduates in research and project participants will work with the University of Montana School of Media Arts to develop interactive outreach materials based on the study system.<br/><br/>Linking genotypes to adaptive phenotypes in nature is a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology. The co-option of existing gene regulatory networks may be an important mechanism underlying the evolution of adaptive traits, particularly adaptive traits that involve coordination among distinct biological processes. This research will explore the role of gene regulatory network co-option in the evolution of seasonal color molts in snowshoe hares. Using RNA sequencing and DNA-protein binding assays in molting snowshoe hare skin, the project will explore the hypothesis that coat color change evolved by the co-option of seasonal hair growth regulatory machinery by coloration genes to synchronize these processes in the seasonal color molts.

Hormones are substances produced in the body that influences the way the body grows or develops. Thyroid hormone plays an important role in the transition of tadpoles into frogs, especially in limb development. Nearly a third of frog species bypass the tadpole stage and develop directly into frogs and the role of thyroid hormone in the development of these species is not known. This project will test two alternative hypotheses about the role of thyroid hormone in this process. In association with the Harvard Museum of Natural History, this project will also develop several educational activities on amphibian biodiversity for K-12 students, teachers, and parents. Some of these activities can be offered at little cost, which will allow many students to experience wildlife and witness the dramatic transformation of metamorphosis for themselves.<br/><br/>Comparing how thyroid hormone regulates gene activity during limb development between direct-developing and metamorphosing frogs can tell us how fundamental endocrine networks evolve and generate different life cycles. Biphasic frogs (which undergo metamorphosis) require thyroid hormone (TH) for metamorphosis and limb development. This study evaluates the role of TH in limb development in the direct-developing frog Eleutherodactylus coqui for comparison to its role in three biphasic frog taxa (Xenopus laevis, Bombina orientalis, and Dendrobates tinctorius). Next-generation sequencing will be used to characterize and compare the TH-induced molecular phenotype in the developing limb of all four species. This study will provide a basis for further studies of amphibian life history evolution and identify interspecific variation in an otherwise highly conserved molecular mechanism of metamorphosis. Characterizing how one group achieves direct development will provide a comparison for investigating the repeated origins of this life history in other amphibians, and address questions at the intersection of endocrinology, evolution, and development.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701591","James","Hanken","hanken@oeb.harvard.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mara","Laslo","mlaslo@fas.harvard.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aquatic invasive species have serious impacts on human and natural communities, and are very expensive to manage. Starry stonewort is considered rare in its native range of Europe and Asia, but has spread prolifically and become invasive since it was discovered in North America in the 1970s. The researchers will compare whole genomic data for algal specimens collected from both the native and non-native range and at different time periods to identify genes responsible for the rapid adaptation of this species to novel habitats in the United States. Results of this work will help in the development of tools and strategies for managing harmful invasive species. The project will involve mentoring of undergraduates, including of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. In addition, the project will develop an algae diversity curriculum for high school and other K-12 students in New York City. <br/><br/>Genomes and genes of Nitellopsis obtusa will be surveyed to test the hypothesis that allele frequency shifts in this species are associated with rapid adaptation to novel chemical and nutrient regimes and novel climatic conditions of the invasive range. Genetic data will be collected from both fresh material and natural history collections, in the form of dried herbarium specimens, from the native and invasive ranges, at time points early and late in the invasion. This spatial and temporal sampling will allow allele frequency shifts to be tracked through time, to determine if significant changes have occurred in the introduced range. The nuclear genome of N. obtusa from native and invasive individuals will be sequenced to test gene content and organization relative to other green algae and land plants. A total of 48 candidate genes, representing an array of key functions, will be sequenced from the temporally stratified native and invasive samples.

When an entire genome is doubled the resulting organism is said to be polyploid. Such events are of enormous economic and biological importance. Most agricultural crops are polyploid, and this duplication created much of the world's plant and animal diversity. After duplication, further changes often occur in gene number, expression, and regulation. Can such modifications generate all the genetic and ecological diversity we see? We know that when genes are translated into protein, genetic pieces can be rearranged in a process called alternative splicing. Does splicing following genome duplication further increase diversity? By studying changes in splicing patterns following duplication, this research will help determine what produces genetic diversity. This information help us understand biodiversity. It also has important economic implications for polyploid crops. Outreach to K-12 students will occur, and a new class module on agriculture for high school students will be developed. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to address fundamental questions regarding the role and extent of RNA alternative splicing (AS) in a recently formed naturally occurring polyploid species in the flowering plant Tragopogon (goatsbeard; sunflower family). This plant genus includes two species that originated via polyploidy only 80 years ago. They serve as natural models for the study of recent and recurring Genomic Duplication (GD). This research will compare the polyploid T. miscellus to its diploid parents (T. dubius and T. pratensis). The following central questions about AS in polyploid species will be answered: (1) Are the patterns of AS in T. miscellus the average of its parents or highly divergent from the parents? (2) Do the same changes in AS occur repeatedly following GD in natural populations of independent origin? (3) Conversely, are aspects of AS highly variable and differ from one formation of this polyploid to the next? To address these questions, a nuclear genome sequence of the diploid T. dubius will be constructed and used as the reference for genome-wide AS detection. This genome will also be of potential economic value because Tragopogon is closely related to lettuce, an important crop. Functional annotation, including gene ontology enrichment analysis, will be used to examine which biological functions (e.g. photosynthesis) are closely linked to genes with changes in AS patterns after GD.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701751","Douglas","Soltis","dsoltis@botany.ufl.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pamela","Soltis","psoltis@flmnh.ufl.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xiaoxian","Liu","xiaoxianliu@ufl.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We need a new vanguard of modeling tools that can cope with the needs of modern computer experiments, particularly their increasing size (big data) and rapidly evolving and refining nature as models become more sophisticated, and supercomputing environments approach the exa-scale. This funded research targets extensions and applications of a new breed of flexible and fast response surface methods, the so-called local approximate Gaussian process (laGP). Our motivating applications come primarily from problems in computer experiments and uncertainty quantification, and ideas are borrowed from -- and will represent an important extension to -- the related literatures of geo-statistics and machine learning. The over-arching goal is a modernization of the response surface and surrogate modeling toolkit to better serve future applications across applied science.<br/><br/>Gaussian process (GP) models are popular in spatial modeling contexts, like geostatistics or computer experiments, where response surfaces are reasonably smooth but little else can be assumed. GP models provide accurate predictors, but increasingly impose computational bottlenecks: large dense matrix decompositions impede efforts to keep pace with modern trends in data acquisition. A scramble is on for fast approximations. Two common themes are sparsity, allowing fast matrix decompositions, and supercomputing, allowing distributed calculation. But these inroads are at capacity. Rapidly expanding mobile device networks, high-resolution satellite imagery (and GPS), and supercomputer simulation generate data of ever-increasing size. This funded research centers on local approximate GP (laGP) models as a means of enabling the powerful GP spatial modeling framework to address modern big data problems. Initial implementations show promise, expanding data size capabilities by several orders of magnitude. However much work remains to ensure that laGP methods can supplant conventional GPs in diverse spatial modeling contexts. Here we propose several methodological enhancements, many involving shortcuts that have provably minimal impact on laGP performance. We are motivated by two big data computer model emulation applications: one involving satellite positioning and another on solar power generation. Yet we are mindful that for our efforts to have impact, the wider spatial modeling context must always be kept in view.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1739097","Benjamin","Haaland","benhaaland@hotmail.com","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Utah","SALT LAKE CITY","841128930","8015816903","75 S 2000 E","United States","Utah","UT","8069","CDS&E-MSS","8083","Big Data Science &Engineering","9263","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE & ENGING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How genes diversify and evolve new functions is a little understood but important area in evolutionary biology. The sense of smell in mammals is the result of extreme diversification of genes that code for proteins that detect chemicals in the environment. Some mammals possess over 1,000 such proteins and others only a few hundred. Quantifying the role of natural selection in this diversification is difficult because current models fail to fully account for the processes involved: gene duplication and loss, mutation, as well as the number of gene copies present. This project will develop mathematical tools that incorporate this complexity and test hypotheses about sensory evolution in bat species with divergent specialized diets. The methods developed in the project will be applicable to many types of genes, including those involved in immune function and pathogen recognition. Through training from the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, the research team will design a short video for the public explaining the value understanding the evolution of smell. They will also implement a summer program for underrepresented Long Island, NJ high school students to learn about bat sensory systems.<br/><br/>Previous research has identified several species of plant-visiting bats that have evolved novel olfactory receptors via gene duplication. The match between dietary specialization and olfactory receptors provides an ideal system to test whether newly evolved receptors are related to a reliance on plant resources. A shift from an insectivorous ancestral bat population to a population that exploits fruit and pollen requires not only new morphological adaptations for consumption of these foods, but also fine-tuning of chemosensory systems to find these plant resources. The challenge of understanding the molecular evolution of the mammalian olfactory gene family has prevented a quantitative investigation of this pattern; this project will develop new methods to identify such adaptation. The focal hypothesis is that increased gene copy retention and diversification is connected to the rapid diversification of Neotropical plant-visiting bats. To test this hypothesis, this research involves three major objectives: (1) determine whether olfactory receptor retention rate is correlated with the increased speciation rate observed in plant-visiting bats, (2) empirically test whether olfactory gene duplicates are adaptive at the species level, and (3) evaluate the functional similarity and novelty of the receptors that have recently duplicated in plant-visiting bats. The project will make use of newly developed gene-tree/species tree reconciliation and gene retention models developed for recently diverged populations, as well as codon substitution models and protein reconstructions to detect how selection may be affecting the function of these hyperdiverse genes.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701414","David","Liberles","daliberles@temple.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","SUNY at Stony Brook","Stony Brook","117940001","6316329949","WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB","United States","New York","NY","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Liliana","Davalos Alvarez","liliana.davalos-alvarez@stonybrook.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Laurel","Yohe","laurel.yohe@stonybrook.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This displacement contributes to the largest international refugee crisis since World War II. Only 1% of those refugees have been resettled to countries where they can restart their lives. This dissertation asks how Syrian refugees make new lives in countries of resettlement by comparing the experience of refugees resettled to the United States, Canada and Italy. War has not only displaced but also declassed the once middle-income families included in this study. These refugees were resettled to each of these countries though they had few if any preexisting ties, did not know the local language, and had skills mismatched to local economies. Most studies of immigration examine outcomes of newcomers years after a cohort's arrival. By contrast, this study focuses on the first 18-24 months after arrival. It considers how Syrian refugees attempt to acquire the skills that matter, how they create new communities, and how their daily lives are shaped by the policy contexts of the countries in which they land. This study has direct, actionable, implications for policy due to its selection of countries with varied resettlement policies for comparison, and its examination of the varied adaptation processes they shape.<br/><br/>This study examines refugees' process of adaptation, defined as the strategies by which newcomers attempt to adjust their family lives, form social relationships, and pursue economic livelihoods in their new setting. This involves refugees finding, together, as families and as an emergent community, new ways of doing things, while retaining aspects of their identity from which they derive a sense of self. This study explores differences in the process of adaptation across political realities of heightened islamophobia, and in the eras of Trump, Trudeau and Pope Francis. This study also looks at country-specific resettlement logics that inform not only the kind of assistance that refugees receive, but also who does the work of resettlement, and the locations where refugees are resettled, near or far from co-ethnics. For this examination, this study uses a combination of ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews. Included in the sample are eighteen Syrian refugee families in New Haven, Connecticut (n=81), five families resettled in and near Toronto, Ontario in Canada (n=25), and six families resettled in the Italian cities of Rome, Todi and Bologna (n=22).","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702803","Viviana","Zelizer","vzelizer@princeton.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

This project will advance understanding of how the type and timing of adverse childhood events affects children with autism and similar vulnerable populations within the fields of sociology, disability studies, and public health, expand current theory to include disability, and inform potential interventions to reduce adverse events in families of children with autism and other vulnerable populations. The broader impacts of this study include contributions to individuals with autism and their families by promoting an increased presence of the experiences of people with autism into current theory and creating knowledge about how children with autism cope with adverse events. <br/><br/>Autism is a lifelong developmental disability estimated to affect 1 in 68 U.S. children. Compared to their peers, this population experiences a variety of health disparities, including decreased well-being, increased family stress, and significantly more adverse childhood experiences (e.g., psychological, physical, or sexual abuse, and/or household dysfunction). Remaining unknowns include: (1) how these disparities may be connected (e.g., does family stress lead to more adverse childhood experiences, which in turn leads to decreased well-being?); (2) how autism itself, as well as the timing of the diagnostic process for autism, may enhance these disparities; (3) how the combination of these disparities may affect life course trajectories of individuals with autism; and (4) how children with autism cope with family stress or adverse experiences. This project will fill in these gaps in the literature by answering three primary questions. Firstly, How is age of diagnosis associated with ACEs (e.g., do these events primarily occur prior to, during, or post diagnosis)? Secondly, For children with autism, how are ACEs related to health, internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and academic performance? Thirdly, Does an expanded construction of resilience (including both internal and external characteristics) mediate the relationship between ACEs and well-being for children with autism? This study requires the collection of original data through a survey instrument, which will be disseminated online to parents of children with autism in five states (Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, and Utah). Disability organizations in each of these states have agreed to distribute the online survey link to potential participants through their electronic listservs. A minimum of 300 parent responses will be collected to provide a large enough sample size for the necessary quantitative analyses.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702171","Stefanie","Mollborn","mollborn@colorado.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bethany","Rigles","Bethany.Rigles@colorado.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Itsweire","Increased submarine melting of Greenland's glaciers has emerged as a plausible trigger for their recent acceleration in mass loss and for quadrupling Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise from 1992-2000 to 2001-2011. Notwithstanding its importance, current understanding of submarine melting is limited and it is presently absent or crudely represented in glacier, ice sheet and climate models. Ocean models are beginning to include freshwater discharge from Greenland, but where and when this freshwater enters the continental shelves is largely unknown. Understanding the dynamics that govern the magnitude and spatial distribution of both submarine melt and freshwater export to the open ocean is a key step in projecting sea level rise and the consequences of the Greenland-induced ocean freshening. A multifaceted approach that includes the analysis of existing observations, a series of laboratory experiments and high-resolution numerical simulations will seek to quantify the sensitivity of submarine melting and freshwater export distribution to the dominant controls, and to derive basic parameterizations that relate submarine melt rates and freshwater export to large-scale parameters including subglacial discharge, fjord size and topography (i.e. sill), and continental shelf hydrography and stratification. The project involves collaborations with international experts from complementary fields and will contribute to fostering interactions between the multiple disciplines involved and beyond national boundaries. One student and one post-doctoral fellow will be exposed to a cutting-edge problem and work within a multidisciplinary team of researchers. Results from this project will be widely disseminated to scientists across disciplines, as demonstrated by the project team's long track record of organizing summer schools and working groups, and to the public through different media outlets, including a blog on polar science. Recent Greenland related work by the project team has been featured in the New York Times, the Weather Channel and Italian National Television, amongst other media.<br/><br/>The exchange of heat and freshwater between the ocean and Greenland's outlet glaciers, typically grounded hundreds of meters below sea level, occurs at the head of long, deep fjords that connect the ice sheet margins to the continental shelves and the large-scale North Atlantic circulation. Recent work by the project team, and others, has shown, for several idealized or specific cases, that the fjord's temperature and stratification, as well as the summer discharge of surface melt at the base of the glacier (subglacial discharge) have a first order impact on the magnitude, distribution and timing of submarine melting. These results will be generalized by formulating parameterizations, suitable for large-scale ice sheet and climate models, of submarine melting and associated freshwater export distributions as a function of large-scale controls. Two specific tasks will be carried out: 1) Establishing dynamical links between submarine melting, and the associated freshwater export from the glacier, and its dominant controls, which include: the magnitude and spatial distribution of subglacial discharge; hydrographic properties and stratification on the continental shelf; and fjord size and topography, in particular the presence and height of a sill. 2) Formulating two complementary parameterizations: one for the magnitude and spatial distribution of submarine melting as a function of the fjord's topography and size, the shelf stratification and the subglacial discharge, to be used in glacier and ice sheet models; and one for the magnitude and vertical distribution of the freshwater export from the fjords to be used in large scale ocean and climate models which do not resolve the fjords. This project involves the analysis of existing data, laboratory experiments and high-resolution numerical simulations. It will be carried out in collaboration with two international experts: a glacial hydrologist (Ian Hewitt at the University of Oxford) and a fjord oceanographer (Lars Arneborg at the University of Goteborg). The work is aimed at understanding a newly discovered ""wiring"" of our climate system and is timely because of the large and unanticipated changes that are occurring at Greenland's margins. It is complementary to the study of ice sheet/ocean interactions around Antarctica (the more studied of the two) since both the large-scale ocean circulation and the presence of narrow, long fjords in Greenland contribute a unique set of relevant dynamical mechanisms.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1737759","Patrick","Heimbach","heimbach@utexas.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","1610","PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH","1324","CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

More than 80% of the world's population live in low- to middle-income countries. These regions are characterized by a high degree of socioeconomic stratification and low levels of intra- and intergenerational mobility. Although extensive research documents patterns of stratification, few studies consider particular mobility pathways available to different classes of workers. As the noted economist, Gary Fields (2013), observed in his recent report to the United Nations, a critical aim of post-2015 development policies should be identifying ""interventions to promote the graduation of the self-employed from one segment to another, higher-earning form of employment."" This dissertation responds to that call by identifying factors associated with both upward and downward economic mobility among the self-employed. Of the major strategies used to address income disparities, educational reform is an important one, but, initial results suggest that policies that provide business capital and access to credit to self-employed workers with little schooling may have the greatest short-term potential to promote mobility. This research also contributes to contemporary debates about immigrant incorporation in the United States. By documenting economic mobility pathways available to Mexican immigrants in their origin communities, this study will contextualize the process of economic incorporation within broader patterns of economic inequality in sending countries. It is impossible to truly understand and incorporate new arrivals without first understanding their origins.<br/><br/>This project investigates two mobility pathways--self-employment and international migration--commonly used by workers of varying social classes in Mexico, a highly unequal country. To do so, the Co-PI will 1) assemble a nationally representative panel dataset of self-employed Mexican workers in 2008-2012; 2) analyze 52 in-depth interviews that were conducted with self-employed return migrants in an urban and industrial community, and 30 interviews that were conducted with self-employed return migrants in a rural and agrarian community; 3) develop a typology of self-employment that identifies marginal, temporary, and successful businesses; and 4) use quantitative methods to analyze how social class and market sector affects the risk of business failure among all self-employed workers. The proposed research will address two related research questions: First, is self-employment a mobility pathway in highly stratified labor markets?

In the last five years Northwest has become a surprising destination for white urban farmers, who have bought cheap homes to fix up, and have converted vacant lots into gardens, parks and farms. Most recent scholars of neighborhood poverty have studied the benefits of moving disadvantaged families out of poor neighborhoods with subsidized housing vouchers - of moving the poor to opportunity. This project, by contrast, will highlight the promises and challenges of moving opportunity to poor residents. It examines whether and how green gentrification in one of the nation's most struggling neighborhoods, combined with federal, city, and philanthropic investments, can help improve neighborhood conditions and the lives of poor residents who remain in place. <br/><br/>To answer this question, this dissertation will draw on multiyear ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews with residents, former residents and community leaders, and historical and quantitative data. The researcher will also conduct fieldwork at the Detroit Land Bank, a city institution that owns a quarter of all property in Detroit. Most previous research on gentrification has focused on working class neighborhoods with a high percentage of rental apartments, located near downtown in densely populated cities. Such research has shown that gentrification has a transforming impact on neighborhoods, but has rejected it as a viable mechanism for inclusive neighborhood revitalization. Northwest, by contrast, is a different kind of neighborhood than those in which gentrification has been studied. It is far from downtown, depopulated, and poor, with a high percentage of homeowners. By 2016 half of all properties in the neighborhood were vacant lots, and one third of remaining houses stood abandoned. If gentrification is such a powerful mechanism for neighborhood change, how and to what extent can this potentially be used to turn around disadvantaged, struggling neighborhoods? Dissertation chapters will draw on the ethnographic case study of Northwest to uncover the tensions between racial residential integration and social segregation in public and organizational life in the neighborhood. Chapters will also examine the potential of ""greening"" to turn around blight, how tax foreclosures shape ongoing displacements of low-income residents, and how the city helps shape the future of land distribution in the neighborhood. In conjunction, these dissertation chapters describe the interactional, organizational and structural challenges to inclusive neighborhood revitalization, as well as the potential that ""farming hope"" brings to Northwest Detroit. Drawing on this study, the researcher will make policy recommendations on how to move opportunity to depopulated, poor neighborhoods across the country.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701177","Mitchell","Duneier","mduneier@princeton.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

Most low-income Americans now enroll in college, but only 11% earn a bachelor's degree within six years. The project documents the many challenges low-income college students face and observes how they deal with these challenges. This research will provide new insights for sociology on why the American Dream can be so elusive. It will also identify ways that high schools, colleges, and federally funded financial aid programs can better support low-income students.<br/><br/>The researcher is spending two years with a small group of students from New Orleans, following them through their senior year of high school and their freshman year of college. As an ethnography of attempted upward mobility focused on the period of the life course when upwardly mobile trajectories are most often derailed, this study will document the most proximate causes of class reproduction for low-income Americans. The study asks two questions: First, what challenges do low-income students face during the transition to college, both in school and out of school, that affect their academic progress? Second, how do students cope with these challenges and make sense of them? Answers to these questions will have important implications for the sociological study of poverty, higher education, and class reproduction. Previous ethnographic work on poverty in America focuses primarily on how low-income people survive poverty and make meaning within it, so this new focus on the experience of trying to escape poverty could shed light on why so few succeed. Moreover, qualitative sociology research to date on the experiences of low-income college students has focused almost exclusively on the small portion of these students who attend selective residential colleges. By studying the experiences of students who live at home while attending community colleges and lower-tier public four-year colleges, this study will provide a needed glimpse of the contexts in which upward mobility most often falters.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702995","Mary","Waters","mcw@wjh.harvard.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Thomas","Wooten","tomwooten@gmail.com","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The intricate structure of the eye is frequently presented as an example that challenges our understanding of evolution by natural selection. Eye size and structure vary tremendously across species and it has been hypothesized that this variation is the result of contrasting ecological pressures, such as differing light levels in different environments. This project's researchers recently showed that predation is associated with evolutionary changes in in the eye size of a killifish on the island of Trinidad. This proposal will build upon this previous research to understand how and why predators select for shifts in eye size. Such work will enhance comprehension of the conditions that favor the evolution of complex traits such as the vertebrate eye. This research will be incorporated into educational modules that will be presented at outreach events to further enhance the public's understanding of evolution by natural selection.<br/><br/>Eye size is positively correlated with the visual capacity of an organism. In turn, vision is closely linked to behaviors that directly and indirectly influence fitness. This connection between variation in eye size and visual aptitude, behavior, and fitness provides the raw materials for divergent ecological conditions to drive evolutionary shifts in eye size. Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii) are found in fish communities on the island of Trinidad that vary in predation intensity. Increased predation is associated with genetically based declines in eye size. This work established a clear link between an ecological selective force and evolutionary shifts in eye size, but it does not establish causation, nor does it explain why predators select for a smaller eye size. This project will leverage a multifaceted approach that includes comparative mark recapture experiments and perturbation experiments in the lab and nature to: (1) quantify how selection operates on eye size in nature, and (2) experimentally test the influence of predators on eye size evolution.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701416","Matthew","Walsh","matthew.walsh@uta.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Arlington","Arlington","760190145","8172722105","1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT","United States","Texas","TX","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shannon","Beston","beston@uta.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In earlier decades, nearly all children attended their neighborhood school. Recent reports suggest, however, that the historically tight relationship between where families live and send their child to school has weakened. With a particular focus on how neighborhood and school processes play out in gentrifying areas, the investigators examine the neighborhood-school link in three key ways: (1) the link between neighborhood and local school racial and socioeconomic composition over time; (2) the link between where families live and whether they enroll their child in the local school; (3) how the loosening link between neighborhoods and schools affects educational outcomes. This dissertation represents one of the first multi-city, longitudinal studies to examine the evolving relationship between neighborhoods and traditional public schools in the U.S.; one of few national-level quantitative studies exploring the relationship between residential and school enrollment choices; and one of the first quantitative studies to explore the relationship between gentrification and schools. While most prior research focuses on either the neighborhood or school environment, this project analyzes both contexts simultaneously and takes seriously the spatial interdependence of neighborhoods and schools, enhancing basic understanding of the changing relationship between neighborhoods and schools. Such an approach will inform policies that jointly consider residential and school contexts. Together, these analyses will contribute to our understanding of trends, mechanisms, and effects of the changing neighborhood-school link and how this relationship unfolds in a context of urban and neighborhood change. Given how demographic changes are reconfiguring urban areas across the U.S., this research has important implications for theory, as well as for urban, housing, and education policies.<br/><br/>Drawing upon multiple waves of data from several national data sources, this dissertation employs statistical analyses to address its questions, as well as geographic software and techniques to match neighborhood and school characteristics to families and students. First, this project combines data from the Census and National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) with unique school attendance boundary data on a subset of U.S. school districts for 2000 and 2010 to examine how school racial and socioeconomic composition changes as neighborhoods change, particularly in schools serving gentrifying neighborhoods. Next, this project moves beyond aggregate-level analyses, combining data from the Census, NCES, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to model school enrollment outcomes among families in gentrifying neighborhoods, exploring how schooling decisions are shaped by family and school characteristics and the availability of alternative schooling options. Finally, the investigators will model the effects of the changing neighborhood-school relationship on student achievement and persistence over time.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702765","Ann","Owens","annowens@usc.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Southern California","Los Angeles","900890001","2137407762","University Park","United States","California","CA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jennifer","Candipan","candipan@usc.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, it analyzes how community, business, and state regulatory organizational characteristics at the branch plant (i.e., gas well) and central headquarters (i.e., operating company) level relate to Texas gas well flaring and venting rates in 2012. This project advances basic understandings of the way social organization influences industrial environmental pollution and waste of natural resources. The primary aim of this project is to assist business practitioners, state managers, and communities to better combat climate change, economic waste, and community health hazards by identifying the social structural factors related to venting and flaring practices in the natural gas production industry and making this information publicly available by publishing high-quality, mobile-friendly maps, presentations, and scientific and technical papers. <br/><br/> Venting and flaring in the gas production industry are processes by which natural gas is extracted from a well and purposefully burned (i.e., flaring) or released or leaked into the air (i.e., venting), sometimes after first collecting the crude petroleum oil and associated gas extracted along with the natural gas. There is currently no systematic explanation for why some organizations in the natural gas production industry vent and flare natural gas at a higher rate than others. There is an urgent need to identify the social organizational structures associated with pollution and waste, so that organizations and public policies can be reorganized to better achieve environmental sustainability. This project will fill this need by testing several hypotheses developed using the organizational political economy of the environment framework. Hypotheses are tested by quantifying the relationship between Texas gas well venting and flaring rates in 2012, and organizational characteristics at the gas well and operating company level using multilevel statistical modeling. Statistical analysis will be conducted on a created dataset using Texas Railroad Commission, National Center for Charitable Statistics, United States Energy Information Administration, and United States Census Bureau data. Using the created dataset, this project will examine the characteristics of affected communities surrounding gas wells and develop high-quality, mobile-friendly maps of gas well venting and flaring rates and overlying business, community, and state regulatory organizational characteristics. By producing high quality maps, presentations, and papers, this project will increase public understanding of scientific knowledge regarding the relationship between social organizational structures and venting and flaring rates.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702683","Theresa","Morris","theresa.morris@tamu.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M University Main Campus","College Station","778454375","9798626777","400 Harvey Mitchell Pkwy South","United States","Texas","TX","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Katherine Ann","Willyard","kate.willyard@tamu.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These attacks are often stealthy, low-and-slow, and disguised via deceptive campaigns. This research focuses on the forensics of cyber attacks targeting enterprise environments, with the goals of (1) understanding an attack's intent, strategy, steps, and targets, (2) collecting digital evidence for legal proceedings, (3) revealing hidden attack behaviors to prevent or minimize damage.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, an integrated framework is being developed which covers three key aspects - temporal, spatial, and malware-behavioral forensics. All three aspects face the common challenge of analyzing binary executables. More specifically, temporal forensics requires finer-grain program logging for identifying attack provenance and ramifications. The solution is to partition a binary program's execution and data for high-accuracy causal analysis. Malware forensics involves revealing malware behaviors that are multi-stage, condition-guarded, and environment-specific. The solution is a new binary analysis approach that force-executes an unknown binary without input or environment setup and exposes the malware's behavior along the execution paths forced into. Temporal forensics requires understanding unknown file formats and in-memory data structure contents. The solution is to identify and reuse the file parsing/generation and data structure rendering logic in the corresponding binary programs.<br/><br/>This research will advance the state-of-the-art in cyber forensics, a critical need as our nation and society become increasingly dependent on cyberinfrastructures. It will help train next-generation cybersecurity experts by exposing students to real case investigations.

This research investigates how certain complex dental characteristics evolved in the ancestors of modern mammals (therapsids), and thus informs our understanding of the selective forces driving mammalian evolution from their ""reptile-like"" ancestors. Mammal teeth are considered more complex and specialized than reptiles; however, these assumptions have not fully considered extinct species. As such, the evolution of complex dental traits is not entirely understood, which leaves our understanding of the ecology and evolution of ancient mammals incomplete. Histological data and analyses from this work will be made available to the scientific community, and the data will be useful for systematists interested in the evolution of vertebrates. Public outreach through displays and programs at natural history museums will also occur. <br/><br/>The dentition of mammals is unique among living vertebrates, and therapsid fossils have shed light on the evolution of mammalian innovations like a regionalized dentition (heterodonty), multiple tooth roots, and tooth-to-tooth occlusion. While it is relatively straightforward to assess these characters using gross morphology, the evolution of other significant features can only be examined through histological thin sections, and thus remain unknown for many fossil taxa. This research fills this void by using paleohistology and micro-computed tomorgraphy data to determine character states for important dental traits in therapsids. Preliminary data suggest that dental traits once thought exclusive to mammals evolved multiple times in their therapsid forebears. This project also tests for correlative evolution between dental and life history traits along the mammal line as well as in reptilian taxa that have independently evolved these complex traits. The work will provide insight into the selective pressures on the acquisition of mammal innovations.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701383","Christian","Sidor","casidor@u.washington.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Megan","Whitney","megwhit@uw.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both of these two closely related bird species live in the highlands of Papua New Guinea; one species occurs at lower elevations, the other occurs at higher elevations. Scientists have long known that tropical mountain ranges, like these in Papua New Guinea, have many more species of plants and animals than expected based on their small total area. However, a fundamental unanswered question is whether random or adaptive evolutionary processes are more important in generating this increased biological diversity. This study will use mathematical models and DNA sequence data collected from field and museum specimens to test alternate explanations for the evolutionary divergence of these two species. Identifying the processes responsible for the evolution of new species is important for understanding the history of life on Earth and for predicting how environmental complexity and change leads to new biological diversity. Results of this work are expected to provide important insights for conservation management of montane bird species. In addition, the project includes creation of public museum displays and other educational outreach activities. <br/><br/>Sister species with differing elevational ranges present a powerful system for understanding the interplay between evolutionary processes and geographic and environmental complexity. This project will explore patterns and drivers of whole genomic differentiation in Syma genus forest kingfishers (Aves: Halcyonidae), a young species pair with parapatric lowland and highland distributions in Papua New Guinea. The researchers will generate single nucleotide polymorphism data and whole genome DNA sequences from samples collected in the field and from natural history museum collections. Using these data they will describe phylogeographic patterns and infer demographic history in both species, estimate phylogenetic relationships and conduct species delimitation, and assess the relative contribution of neutral and adaptive evolutionary processes. In combination, these analyses will provide a test of a hypothesis of ecological speciation in Syma due to disruptive natural selection across an elevational gradient. The research will additionally reveal important clues regarding the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for disproportionate species richness in tropical montane systems.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701224","John","Klicka","klicka@uw.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ethan","Linck","elinck@uw.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand what promotes the persistence of ant diversity, the association between physical traits, such as spines and stings, and ecological interactions, like competition and defenses against predators, must be experimentally determined. This project will investigate one of the most widespread and commonly encountered ant groups in tropical Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, the spiny ant, Polyrhachis. Using ecological field experiments, this research will assess the effect of a wide range of anatomical defenses on ant competition and anti-predator defense. It will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that promote biodiversity in tropical habitats. Furthermore, this project will foster international collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and those in China. The researchers will also actively participate in numerous outreach and public engagement opportunities in Chicago, including various science education programs at the Field Museum of Natural History, and academic tutoring of middle and high school students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>To elucidate the ecological selective forces driving spine adaptation and specialization in Polyrhachis, the researchers will conduct a series of competition and predator-prey experiments at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) in Yunnan, China. These experiments will include a range of species that are present at this site and that span the full range of spine morphology, from absent to extremely long. In the first set of tests, the researchers will assess the impact of spines on interspecific ant competition. In the second, the researchers will quantify the survival benefit conferred by spines as defenses against frog predators. These experiments will be conducted in the lab using colonies collected in the field. A common chamber design with experimental spine length manipulation will allow for differentiating the survival effects of spine length in terms of two fundamental ecological interactions. Using data from these experiments, the researchers will evaluate the evidence for an ecological trade-off between competitive ability and anti-predator defense mediated by spines. These empirical tests of the trade-off hypothesis in Polyrhachis, a remarkable animal radiation, will expand scientific understanding of the processes that promote community coexistence and ecological success.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701352","Corrie","Moreau","cmoreau@fieldmuseum.org","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Chicago","Chicago","606375418","7737028669","5801 South Ellis Avenue","United States","Illinois","IL","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Benjamin","Blanchard","bblanchard@fieldmuseum.org","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These frogs are well known for their brightly colored patterns, which serve as warning signals to deter potential predators. Within one small group of Poison-dart frogs (Phyllobates), vivid bright yellow colorations have independently evolved multiple times from dark, striped ancestors; in one species, different color morphs even occur within the same population. The researchers will take advantage of new genomic technologies and statistical analyses to identify the genes that differ between striped and solid-colored frogs. Results will provide critical insights on the genetic processes that underlie the independent evolution of color pattern variants in this group of frogs. The research will also reveal important information on the spread of beneficial genetic mutations within and across populations. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. Planned outreach includes public seminars and educational activities for elementary and middle school children. <br/><br/>To pinpoint the genetic elements responsible for convergent evolution across Phyllobates species, this project takes advantage of ontogenetic, interspecific, and intraspecific variation in color pattern. First there is striking variation in color pattern between two pairs of closely related Phyllobates lineages, and within a population of Phyllobates aurotaenia from the upper San Juan River in Colombia. The researchers will use exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing to find loci that are highly differentiated between striped and solid-colored lineages, and statistically associated with color pattern variation within P. aurotaenia. Second, gene expression during coloration development will be studied using RNAseq, in order to identify genes that are up or down-regulated when changes in coloration occur throughout development. These two approaches will yield a set of putative loci behind color pattern variation in Phyllobates. The researchers will then use a combination of molecular phylogenetics and coalescent simulations to infer the evolutionary history of these loci, in order to shed light on the genetic mechanisms behind the convergent evolution of bright yellow coloration in this group of frogs.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702014","Marcus","Kronforst","mkronforst@uchicago.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Chicago","Chicago","606375418","7737028669","5801 South Ellis Avenue","United States","Illinois","IL","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roberto","Marquez","rmarquezp@uchicago.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sperm cells that do not carry DNA cannot fertilize an egg, thus the existence of such sperm cells in butterflies and moths is puzzling. Almost all of these insects make two types of sperm: both traditional, DNA-bearing sperm, and a second type that lacks DNA. In all of these cases, males make far more of this DNA-lacking sperm than traditional sperm. The sheer abundance of this sperm type implies it plays some yet-unknown functional role in reproduction. This proposal aims to uncover the evolutionary significance of these DNA-lacking sperm cells. The research will also aid in the development of technologies that will allow scientists to maintain important genetically modified lineages in a way that is both cheaper and less vulnerable to failure than traditional rearing methods. Such protocols could even be extended to threatened species to create a gene bank. Outreach to the public will occur via summer science workshops.<br/><br/>Production of multiple sperm types by a single male has independently arisen in many animal lineages. In all well-studied cases, evidence suggests that only one type of sperm retains its ability to fertilize eggs but the function of these non-fertilizing sperm remains unclear. Nowhere is this more apparent than in butterflies and moths; males of this order produce a secondary sperm type that lacks nuclear DNA. These anucleated cells represent a significant investment for a male, outnumbering their nucleated sperm by 20-to-1, but cannot possibly fertilize eggs to directly increase male fitness. Several hypotheses have been proposed since the discovery of anucleated sperm to explain the existence of anucleated sperm, but to-date no rigorous tests have been undertaken. This project will develop and refine artificial insemination protocols in two lepidopteran species that differ in mating strategy in order to thoroughly test the function of anucleated sperm in different selective backgrounds with a common framework.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701931","James","Walters","jrwalters@ku.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kansas Center for Research Inc","LAWRENCE","660457568","7858643441","2385 IRVING HILL RD","United States","Kansas","KS","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrew","Mongue","ajmongue@gmail.com","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood","Arsenic is a trace element that can be toxic to people and at lower concentrations cause neurological symptoms or have immunological and endocrine effects. Throughout history, arsenic has been used as a poison, pesticide, weapon, and it has contaminated more than a billion-people's food and water supplies. In addition, a number of groundwater springs worldwide have naturally occurring arsenic levels that exceed those safe for human drinking water. As this groundwater seeps into streams the elevated arsenic can affect the chemistry and biology of the stream. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) research integrates arsenic into an ongoing study of streams in Ecuador to assess what drives arsenic retention in stream plants and animals and how that affects the transport of arsenic downstream. Understanding how arsenic interacts with other elements to cycle through water supplies will inform global mitigation efforts. Furthermore, the researchers will disseminate results to Ecuadorian communities reliant on arsenic contaminated waters. <br/><br/>Elevated stream arsenic concentrations can alter stream ecosystem function by altering the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus or via altering aquatic food webs. In addition, the bioavailability and effects of arsenic on aquatic food webs are closely interlinked with both the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus present in aquatic systems. Funds from this award will be used to evaluate how the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio of stream water affects the retention and transport of arsenic in geothermal streams with varying nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. The study also will test the effect of stream resource nitrogen:phosphorus ratio on arsenic cycling in the aquatic food web and biotic excreation of arsenic and consequent downstream transport.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1701839","Alexander","Flecker","asf3@cornell.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Keeley","MacNeill","klm324@cornell.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood","Drought is becoming more common in the southwestern US, resulting in higher tree mortality. Surviving trees may experience legacy effects of drought: decreases in growth rates for multiple years. These trees may not fully recover before the next drought arrives, increasing the risk that more will die. One potential mechanism driving these legacy effects is related to how trees store and use sugars. Drought may change trees' ability to use stored sugars, because they are moved by water in tree tissues. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) will provide funds to compare trees under different levels of drought stress to understand how drought changes the availability of sugars in trees, and how these changes are related to tree growth rates and legacy effects, using tree rings and the age of sugars in different rings. This research is important because it will improve understanding of how trees respond physiologically to drought, which could improve predictions of how environmental change will affect forests. Accurate predictions about drought effects on US forests is critical for management of associated local (fire, flooding, etc.) and global (altered carbon cycling) negative impacts.<br/><br/>This study will address: (1) what are the effects of drought stress on storage dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in foundation tree species, and, (2) how are these dynamics related to legacy effects of drought in southwestern US forests? This project focuses on two foundational Populus species, because angiosperms exhibit complex drought legacy effects and are more reliant on NSC storage. Tree cores from 14 genotypes of Populus fremontii experiencing varying levels of apparent drought stress at the Palo Verde Common Garden were collected in 2015. Tree cores and respired CO2 will also be collected from Populus tremuloides individuals at four sites differing in drought stress across the Four Corners region. This study will analyze tree-ring wood and gas samples for 14C content to assess carbon fixation date, age, and availability of NSCs in tree rings of different ages, and for delta13C to assess drought stress. 14C and delta13C data will be related to ring widths and water stress/use indices using hierarchical models to understand the role of NSC dynamics in drought legacy effects. This study will develop an inexpensive, novel incubation method for obtaining CO2 for 14C analysis, bypassing existing difficulties with NSC extraction procedures. These isotopic methods will help elucidate links between drought stress and NSC storage, with implications for how foundation tree species will respond to climate change.","03/10/2017","03/10/2017","1702017","Kiona","Ogle","Kiona.Ogle@nau.edu","03/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Northern Arizona University","Flagstaff","860110001","9285230886","ARD Building #56, Suite 240","United States","Arizona","AZ","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Drew","Peltier","dmp334@nau.edu","03/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To address the demand of business and industry for these professionals, North Arkansas College (Northark) has designed this project to increase the number of skilled technicians who are trained in network technology with a cybersecurity focus. The project team will enhance and expand their program by infusing the existing Information Technology/Network Systems Administration curricula with cyber security components. The Business/Industry Leadership Team (BILT) at the college will play an active role in setting the direction of the IT program as they have an increased need for more highly trained skilled technicians in IT/Cyber. The project will assist in diversifying the workforce and growing the economy in rural areas by providing access to high-tech jobs for low income students. The results of this project will be life changing and will provide a pathway out of poverty for many students and their families. Northark will share all aspects of the project, including newly developed methods of engaging Business and Industry (the BILT model), methods to offer course materials remotely, strategies to recruit and provide access to rural students, and curricular improvements, on a website devoted to this project and at in-state, regional, and national conferences. A comprehensive evaluation will determine which components of the project are most effective and where modifications are needed.<br/><br/>Because many residents in the service area of the college and other parts of Arkansas, especially those in rural areas, do not have access to the resources required, Northark will utilize technology to support remote delivery of course content through web and virtual options, as well as expanded face to face opportunities at satellite locations and high schools. It will also create a concurrent credit track to allow high school students to complete an IT/Cyber Certificate of Proficiency, actively recruit rural and high school students to enter this high tech field, and add an Academic/Career coach who will provide support that will increase retention, degree completion, and job placement. Using available NSF-ATE curriculum and open source materials, faculty at the college will adapt and enhance the existing IT program with Cybersecurity topics and adapt all curricula for distance delivery. Northark will pilot test distance delivery of this high tech coursework to rural students who do not otherwise have access to such curricular opportunities. The program will be promoted by BILT members and current students and the college will utilize recruiting strategies adapted from other ATE projects to attract more students to this updated flexibly-delivered program.","03/13/2017","03/13/2017","1700632","Laura","Berry","lberry@northark.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","North Arkansas College","Harrison","726017281","8703913280","1515 Pioneer Drive","United States","Arkansas","AR","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Craig","Cates","ccates@northark.edu","03/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cheryl","Keymer","ckeymer@northark.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Nikki","Davidson","ndavidson@northark.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The need for a GST workforce that possesses current industry-defined skills and competencies is expanding at a rapid rate. Today, GST is becoming an essential tool in fields including (but not limited to) emergency response, sustainability, agro-science, energy, and a variety of STEM disciplines. These occupations require a skillset in the analysis of spatial data and geo-visualization. One impact of this project will be the national expansion and diversification of a GST workforce that possesses relevant and current industry-defined GST skills and competencies. GeoTech Center research has identified a lack of educational materials to meet the needs of the broad geospatial community of users. Curricula that are standardized and contextual, and that can be used in traditional college learning environments, as well as by individuals for self-improvement, is desperately needed. The GeoTech Center will design and develop industry-aligned educational materials that can be used in a modularized format and portable to different learning environments.<br/><br/>The GeoTech Center has four integrated Goals: 1) Research emerging trends and uses of GST; 2) Develop industry-aligned curriculum for new and incumbent users of GST; 3) Investigate best practices to increase (and retain) the number of underserved and underrepresented populations (including veterans, women, minority groups, and persons with disabilities) into GST and STEM fields; and 4) Develop and implement professional development opportunities and resources for secondary and post-secondary faculty. In order to successfully accomplish its Goals, the Center will build on strong, documented relationships with professional GST organizations and provide new and current workers access to educational resources to assist them in filling any gaps in their GST skillset (and for them to receive recognition of those skills through micro-credentials and professional certifications). The Center will expand its Community of Practice and address specific educational needs of targeted audiences, including underserved and underrepresented students, veterans, and faculty in STEM disciplines. The efforts of the Center to accomplish its Goals will provide the optimum framework and resources to increase the number and diversity of learners and workers who possess industry-defined GST skills and competencies.","03/13/2017","03/13/2017","1700496","Vincent","DiNoto","Vince.DiNoto@kctcs.edu","03/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Kentucky Community & Technical College System","Versailles","403831245","8592563100","300 North Main Street","United States","Kentucky","KY","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ken","Yanow","kyanow@swccd.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Richard","Schultz","richs@elmhurst.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Ann","Johnson","ann@BareMt.com","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nicole","Ernst","nlernst@hacc.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasingly industries require a multi-skilled technician such as those with a Mechatronics degree, which blends mechanical and electrical engineering technology with computer control and information technology. To address these current and emerging needs, Alamance Community College (ACC) will partner with local high schools and advanced manufacturing industries in North Carolina to prepare a qualified mechatronics trained workforce through an initiative called the Mechatronics Technology Institute (MechTech Institute). This project is designed to build a mechatronics workforce pipeline by increasing the awareness of and preparation for opportunities in mechatronics of high school students. The concept and design of the MechTech Institute was inspired and informed by successful NSF-ATE-funded models addressing student recruitment into and preparation for career opportunities. Through impacting Alamance-Burlington School System instructors and counselors and approximately 720 students, the MechTech Institute will contribute to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and teacher development.. It will also help address the need for stable, well-paid employment in Alamance County and surrounding regions by working with industry partners and county high schools to build a sustainable pipeline of qualified students from public high school through college into the mechatronics workforce. It will serve as an integral piece of a larger mechatronics technician education initiative at the college involving curriculum development, capital expansion, and student recruitment and support. An experienced evaluator from UNC-Greensboro SERVECenter will determine the impact and effectiveness of the project. Information and products will be freely disseminated with educational institutions, training providers, and economic and workforce development stakeholders to benefit the advanced technological education community in the country.<br/><br/>The project goals will be achieved by providing professional development to high school STEM instructors and counselors through: 1) one-day workshops during the school year and a week-long summer workshop, each providing participants with mechatronics materials and equipping them to integrate mechatronics-based lesson plans, project kits and hands-on activities into their STEM classes, 2) exposure to the mechatronics workplace through industry tours, speakers, and makers-guild events, and 3) an online resource community providing participants with ongoing support. The Institute will incorporate into each component the best practices, lessons learned, and data gathered from similar NSF-ATE projects. Proven elements of these models such as hands-on and activity-oriented learning, STEM/mechatronics content integration, the leveraging of technology for educational engagement, and real-world industry experiences will be adapted and employed to serve the needs of students through the development of these skills in high school instructors. The industry-exposure component is also based on similar recent and current NSF-funded project models which have reported significant benefits to participant and student awareness and interest from features such as guided workplace tours and demonstrations and face-to-face interactions with members of the current workforce. The MechTech Institute will seek to adapt these features to the particular business and industry environment and student populations in the county to maximize the impact of this component to increase student awareness and interest in mechatronics education and career paths. The online resource community to be established as part of the MechTech Institute follows well established NSF-funded precedents which have already been integrated into Alamance County Schools policy in the form of Professional Learning Communities. The MechTech Institute online resource community will have an even greater impact as part of a larger teacher-development initiative designed to meet the critical need for on-going participant support, a forum for sharing best practices, and a direct means for gathering and implementing feedback.","03/13/2017","03/13/2017","1700652","Paul","Carr","Paul.carr@alamancecc.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Alamance Community College","Graham","272538000","3365064224","1247 Jimmie Kerr Rd, Ext150 I-85","United States","North Carolina","NC","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mohamad","Haj-Mohamadi","mohamad.haj-mohamadi@alamancecc.edu","03/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, despite its importance, the factors that regulate the movement of carbon from plants to soils remain poorly understood, particularly the relative contribution of leaves and stems versus roots. Assessing the vulnerability of soil carbon to disruption by environmental changes depends on understanding the factors that control aboveground versus belowground carbon from plants. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant research will provide funds to conduct laboratory experiments to simulate the movement of plant carbon to the soil, and to quantify how the source of plant carbon dictates its fate in the soil. For example, the researchers will evaluate whether carbon entering the soil from the shoots of the plant is stored more or less effectively than carbon being supplied via roots. The objectives of this work are: 1) to improve global carbon models to better describe the terrestrial carbon cycle, and 2) inform practices in forestry, agriculture, and other types of land management that are looking to maximize the amount of plant carbon stored in soils. The investigators will also train students and develop multimedia outreach activities with a natural history museum to inform the broader public on the relevance of this work. <br/><br/>Considerable scientific debate exists around the relative roles of aboveground versus belowground plant inputs as sources of soil organic carbon. This debate must be resolved if the terrestrial carbon cycle is to be accurately modeled because preliminary evidence suggests substantial differences in the fate of above- vs. belowground inputs that may strongly influence rates of accumulation of soil organic carbon pools and their dynamics. This research will conduct empirical studies that test mechanistic differences that underpin aboveground versus belowground plant carbon pathways, independent of the quantity and quality of carbon flowing through them. This project uses a series of microcosm experiments to test hypotheses about the mechanistic differences in how carbon flows through aboveground and belowground plant pathways to the soil. The common plant carbon compound glucose (isotopically labeled with the heavy stable isotope of carbon) will be added to soil microcosms to assess key differences underlying belowground versus aboveground pathways to the soil carbon pool. This research will deepen knowledge of how soil carbon is formed from plant carbon and improve the ability of models to predict carbon dynamics under future environmental conditions.","03/13/2017","03/13/2017","1701027","Noah","Sokol","noah.sokol@yale.edu","03/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mark","Bradford","mark.bradford@yale.edu","03/13/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cellular therapies involve implanting cells into a patient with the goal of treating disease, such as immune cells to target and kill cancer or insulin-secreting cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge is to monitor the cells after their introduction, both for continued survival and for function. This I-Corp project would explore the commercialize potential of a technology that could be used in current cell therapies and during development of new ones. This technology could dramatically reduce the multibillion-dollar therapeutic development costs by providing crucial information regarding how therapeutic cells function in animals during laboratory tests, and could significantly improve bio-manufacturing efficiency, a category that accounts for more than 25% of the cost to produce cell therapies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology platform that would allow cells to report on their function by secreting a small RNA molecule (barcode) into the bloodstream. Depending on how it is introduced into the genome of the cell, this barcode could report on the continued persistence of the cells or on whether the cells are expressing a particular gene and therefore performing a specific function. Multiple barcodes could be combined to report on cellular persistence and several functions simultaneously. This technology will allow, for the first time, the monitoring of function of implanted cells inside animals.

Worldwide, only 5-10 % of clays studied to date are antibacterial when hydrated and tested in vitro. Most antibacterial clays are from hydrothermally altered volcanics, where volcanogenic fluids produce minerals containing reduced metals. Ferruginous illite-smectite (I-S) is the most common clay mineral, although kaolins dominate some samples. Antibacterial clay mineral assemblages may also contain non-clay reduced Fe-minerals (e.g., pyrite) that oxidize, causing damage to cell membranes and intracellular proteins. The key is that the clay mineral assemblage buffers the hydration water to pH and Eh conditions that release metals critical to the antibacterial process, allowing interaction with the bacteria. Antibacterial clays also exchange structural ions with the bacterial membrane that weaken bacterial defenses. This research will take this new understanding of the antibacterial process, to the next level by testing their effect on biofilms. Infectious diseases in humans commonly form biofilms, which are communities of bacteria more resistant to antibiotics than the ""free floating"" bacterial suspensions tested. The effectiveness of antibacterial clay on biofilms is an important step in supporting the costly testing of the bactericidal effect in animal trials. If antibacterial clay is effective against biofilms, in vivo testing may lead to design of new treatments for antibiotic resistant bacteria, with potential applications in wound dressings, medical implants (joint replacements, catheters), animal feed stocks, agricultural pathogens, and production of antibacterial building materials. <br/><br/>The scientific goal of this research is to document the effect of an antibacterial clay previously tested against a broad spectrum of planktonic human pathogens, on biofilms most common to infectious diseases. In collaboration with infectious disease researchers at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), the investigator will develop protocols for the application of clays to biofilms and evaluate conditions that lead to, or limit, their antibacterial activity. Clinical isolates of common and antibiotic resistant bacterial strains will be tested. The investigator has demonstrated that antibacterial clays release metals (Aluminum, Iron) that act together to damage cell membranes and intracellular proteins so they will monitor the interaction of these metals with the biofilms. Standard methods for testing antibiotics must be modified for testing natural clay because the minerals, while releasing metals, are not completely dissolved and therefore will affect spectroscopic evaluations of bacterial viability. Furthermore, the investigator found that metal speciation in various growth media affect results by limiting metal reactivity with bacteria. Therefore, healthy biofilms grown on Teflon disks will be incubated with clay suspensions and cultures will be evaluated for viability by serial dilution and plate counting. If successful, this project will bridge the gap between mineralogy and medicine promoting applications of clay or its derivatives to antibiotic resistant infections. This will enhance development of medical protocols for evaluating minerals that improve human health. The ultimate benefit to society will be to establish an economical and safe natural mineral cure for antibiotic-resistant infections. Proof of the antibacterial activity and safety for applications in wound care may lead to an economic use of clays to treat wounds, or to development of new medicines that incorporate similar antibacterial properties.","03/14/2017","03/14/2017","1719325","Lynda","Williams","Lynda.Williams@asu.edu","03/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","7295","GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kimbrel","Vast amounts of digitized images and videos are now commonly available, and the advent of search engines has further facilitated their access. This has created an exceptional opportunity for the application of machine learning techniques to model human visual perception. However, the data often does not conform to the core assumption of machine learning that training and test images are drawn from exactly the same distribution, or ""domain."" In practice, the training and test distributions are often somewhat dissimilar, and distributions may even drift with time. For example, a ""dog"" detector trained on Flickr may be tested on images from a wearable camera, where dogs are seen in different viewpoints and lighting conditions. The problem of compensating for these changes--the domain adaptation problem--must therefore be addressed both in theory and in practice for algorithms to be effective. This problem is not just a second-order effect and its solution does not constitute a small increase in performance. Ignoring it can lead to dramatically poor results for algorithms ""in the field.""<br/><br/>This project will develop a core suite of theory and algorithms for PErceptual Adaptive Representation Learning (PEARL), which, when given a new task domain, and previous experience with related tasks and domains, will provide a learning architecture likely to achieve optimal generalization on the new task. We expect PEARL to have a significant impact on the research community by providing a much-needed theoretical and computational framework that takes steps toward unifying the subfields of domain adaptation theory and domain adaptation practice. Our theoretical and practical advancements will impact many application areas by allowing the use of pre-trained perceptual models (visual and otherwise) in new situations and across space and time. For example, in mobile technology and robotics, PEARL will help personal assistants and robots better adapt their perceptual interfaces to individual users and particular situated environments. At the core of this project are three main research thrusts: 1) making theoretical advances for domain adaptation by developing generalized discrepancy distance minimization; 2) using the theoretical guarantees of generalized discrepancy distance to develop algorithms for key adaptation scenarios of deep perceptual representation learning, domain adaptation with active learning, and time-dependent adaptation; 3) advancing the theory and developing algorithms for the multiple-source adaptation scenario. In addition to our core aims, we plan to implement our algorithms within a scalable open-source framework, and evaluate our algorithms on large-scale visual data sets.","03/14/2017","03/14/2017","1723379","Kate","Saenko","saenko@bu.edu","03/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Trustees of Boston University","BOSTON","022151300","6173534365","881 COMMONWEALTH AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7239","Algorithms in the Field","012Z","AitF FULL Projects",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because preterm babies are exposed to hospital surroundings that are very different from the environment of the womb, sound stimulation in the form of loud equipment and staff interactions creates an environment that can potentially negatively affect human development. Premature infants spend weeks or even months in the NICU and are thus exposed to these potentially nonideal environments for long periods of time. The technology developed with this project can potentially provide a cost-effective and simple method to improve outcomes and development of premature infants in NICU.<br/><br/>Leveraging a digital technique developed as part of this team's research, this I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of neonatology research applying recorded, individualized, intra-abdominal sounds from pregnant mothers.

The work builds off research showing that these low cost techniques can improve vital sign instability and stress levels in premature infants. The I-Corps technology pursued with this project involves a wearable device that can capture high fidelity recordings around the womb. These recordings include biological sounds such as the heart, lungs and intestines at a low pitch not captured in currently available commercial products.

This project concerns string theory, one of the most vibrant areas of research at this interface. As we explore the boundaries of the regime of validity of string theory and address some of its theoretical shortcomings and the conditions of its peaceful co-existence with the theory of gravity, we rely on increasingly sophisticated mathematical models. F-theory is one of the most geometric corners of string theory and relies on elliptic fibrations to geometrically engineer models for particle physics and gravity at very high energy. This project explores the mathematics that governs the physics of F-theory in order to bring new insights to the mathematics of elliptic fibrations. Elliptic fibrations are geometric spaces that locally look like a long-exposure picture of an elliptic curve moving over another space. Elliptic curves are some of the oldest but yet most prominent objects across mathematics. They are studied in algebraic geometry and number theory and play a central role in representation theory, cryptography (where they are used to secure internet's transactions), computer modeling, and theoretical physics. This multi-disciplinary project will explore connections between these mathematical and physical concepts and will also encourage graduate students both in mathematics and physics to study problems at the interface of physics and mathematics. The PI will also reach out to students from underrepresented groups to inspire them to participate in the scientific endeavor. <br/><br/>Geometric engineering is the construction of physical systems by geometric methods. This is a natural approach in the context of string theory, where the geometry of extra dimensions and the dualities between different formulation and regimes of the theory allow for a geometric formulation of many physical constraints. This project focuses on the geometry of elliptic fibrations as seen from the point of view of string theory, with strong interest in their topology, arithmetic properties, and connection to gauge theories, Grand Unified Theories, and topological defects. The research will also address the problem of resolution of singularities of Weierstrass models and its connection to Mori's theory and representation theory and will explore the structure of the singular fibers of elliptic fibrations over higher dimensional spaces. The PI will also study the physics of topological defects such as cosmic string solutions using new models of elliptic fibrations. A central theme of this project is the prominent role of singularities, their resolutions, and their topological invariants.","03/14/2017","03/14/2017","1701635","Jonathan","Esole","mboyoesole@gmail.com","03/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Northeastern University","BOSTON","021155005","6173732508","360 HUNTINGTON AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the average age of existing aircraft is extending beyond the design life, fatigue cracks are a major issue that requires close monitoring to ensure continued airworthiness. Extensive and time consuming manual non-destructive inspection programs have been implemented to monitor and insure the safety and structural integrity of the aircraft. The Wavenumber Spiral Frequency-Steerable Acoustic Transducer (WS-FSAT) is a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) sensor that enables inspection of in hard-to-reach areas within an aircraft or other asset, where significant structural risk is present, and promises to enable remote inspection of critical structures without disassembly. The technology has the advantage of inherent directional sensing capabilities over relatively wide areas, which translates to lower size, weight and installation costs. Potential benefits include the reduction of the time and cost of inspections, and of the associated aircraft downtime, and of structural integrity risks through more frequent monitoring of structural risk areas. The proposed I-Corp program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of the technology within the aerospace industry and its broader applicability for inspection and monitoring of structural components.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores application and market opportunities for the Wavenumber Spiral Frequency-Steerable Acoustic Transducer (WS-FSAT).

WS-FSATs have inherent directional capabilities with the ability to detect, locate and characterize structural defects with significantly lower hardware and signal processing complexity than other approaches. The WS-FSAT maps the direction of wave sensing to a specific frequency component in the spectrum of the received signal, which greatly facilitates the identification and localization of damage. These directional capabilities rely on the design of the electrodes on a sensing substrate that performs the transduction of mechanical strains associated with waves propagating in the structure to an electrical signal. Such design process is at the core of the technology, and is suitable to meet the needs of inspection of complex structural components.","03/14/2017","03/14/2017","1736060","Massimo","Ruzzene","ruzzene@gatech.edu","03/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By speeding the construction of vaccine and immunotherapeutic candidates, we will make the overall discovery process faster and more effective, and the production process faster and less expensive. By shortening the time of discovery and manufacture, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole can be more responsive to emerging threats. The technology can also be potentially applied to immunotherapy against cancer and other diseases.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project combines two core capabilities: the development of protein nanoparticles derived from viruses as platforms that stimulate the immune system toward molecules attached to them, and highly efficient chemical reactions that make attachments to the protein nanoparticles easy and scalable. Since the molecules that define different infectious agents or disease states can vary widely, such efficient connecting reactions are necessary to make the construction of vaccine candidates routine and modular. Research has defined the methods and linkages needed, and has validated the use of certain protein nanoparticles as effective immune-stimulating agents. Proofs of concept have been achieved for certain bacterial and parasitic infections, characterized by the display of unique sugar-like molecules on the surfaces of the infectious organisms.

Outreach to the public and K-12 students will occur as part of this project, and undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research. <br/> <br/>The strength and direction of natural selection on phenotypic variation is not equal among all individuals within a population. In particular, genetic correlations between the sexes can produce intralocus sexual conflicts when selection acts antagonistically between males and females.  Recent work has shed light on the evolutionary constraint that sexually antagonistic selection can produce, but its role in the general process of adaptation remains unclear. Theory suggests that intralocus sexual conflict will be minimal in a population adapting to a novel environment and will emerge only when populations approach their adaptive peaks. This research will address the role of intralocus sexual conflict on the adaptive process by answering these questions: (1) Does sexually antagonistic selection and the resulting sexual conflict influence the adaptive process from the start or does it have more of an influence later when trait values approach their optimum? (2) Does the antagonistic relationship between the sexes change over time allowing for or limiting the evolution of sexual dimorphism? This project integrates the experimental study of evolution with the statistical tools of a large-scale mark-recapture project and next-generation sequencing.

These processes can differ widely among species, but other features are more conserved between species. Previous work by the researchers showed that the North American green frog and humans share portions of the genome that are important for determining whether an embryo becomes a male or female. Importantly, the researchers discovered that the gene DMRT1, which is critical for human male gonads to develop as normal testes, is also important in green frog development. The researchers also noted widespread abnormalities in green frog development in suburban neighborhoods. This might indicate that human-derived contaminants interfere with how frogs develop. That work was conducted on green frogs in Connecticut. However, green frogs range across half of the United States and parts of Canada, and variation occurs across that range. In addition, work in one European and one Japanese frog species shows variation among populations across the species' range. This project will study the genomic variation in the gene DMRT1 and other genomics regions linked to development in green frogs across the United States. This project will substantially advance our understanding of how variable the genetic basis of development is across a large geographic area. It will also begin to show the extent to which environmental conditions across the country impact frog development. The work will be distributed to the public in a variety of ways including online blogs and guest lectures for K-12 teachers. <br/><br/>Using tissue samples collected from male and female green frogs from representative regions across the species' range, the researchers will test for geographic variation in allele frequencies and linkage for DMRT1. Additionally, the researchers will test whether a set of genetic markers shown to be linked with particular chromosomes specific to males and females are similarly linked across the species range. Geographic areas with varying degrees of this linkage, either for DMRT1 or the other markers, will indicate regions of the species' range where environmental conditions are more likely to influence the processes driving whether an embryo becomes male or female.","03/15/2017","03/15/2017","1701311","Max","Lambert","max.lambert@yale.edu","03/15/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"David","Skelly","david.skelly@yale.edu","03/15/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Of these animals, bees are some of the most effective and important pollinators of wild plants and their service as pollinators to agricultural systems is worth hundreds of billions of dollars each year. In addition to the familiar domesticated European honeybee, there are at least 20,000 other species of wild bees worldwide. Many of these wild bee populations, however, are declining in number due to human-caused landscape changes, including urbanization. This research explores how urban landscapes alter the types of bee species found in cities, how urban bees use and pollinate native plants, and how different-sized bee species move through urban areas. As a part of this project, researchers will make recommendations to land owners to promote healthy pollinator communities. In addition, this project will enrich the scientific community by employing college and high school students from underserved communities as research assistants. <br/><br/>The study will investigate the impacts of urban land use patterns on plant-pollinator interactions using a network analysis approach. The plant-pollinator networks across an urban gradient will be developed through observations of floral visits by bees and the examination of pollen diversity collected from bees found along a gradient of urbanization (40 sites ranging in urban coverage from 0-100 %). As previous observations indicate that urbanized areas contain fewer food resources than rural areas, the researchers predict that bees at urban sites may visit a greater variety of floral species, whereas bees in rural sites may be more specialized in their food choices. To investigate dispersal and colonization patterns within urban landscapes, this study will also examine the genetic make-up of two closely related carpenter bee species. These species are similar in nesting behavior, but vary in size and thus their dispersal potential. The researchers predict that the larger species (Xylocopa virginica) will show fewer genetic signatures of population isolation (ex. inbreeding) than the smaller species (Ceratina strenua) because they can disperse farther through urban areas. Ultimately, results from this study will allow inferences on how pollinators can persist in urban landscapes over time.","03/15/2017","03/15/2017","1701469","Shalene","Jha","sjha@austin.utexas.edu","03/15/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kimberly","Ballare","kballare@utexas.edu","03/15/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Toxic algal blooms occur when certain algal species become highly abundant and release toxins into the water that harm wildlife or humans. Although toxic blooms have been increasing in frequency and severity, our understanding of the factors that cause such species to either become highly abundant or to die back is still very limited. Most research has focused on how environmental factors, such as water pollution, affect bloom formation, but this explanation is inadequate in many cases. In the focal species certain genetic strains do not produce toxins; this study will test the unique hypothesis that large changes in Prymnesium population abundance result from the cooperation and competition among toxic and non-toxic genetic strains. In nature, many species exhibit cooperative behavior, even when it is not in the best interest of the cooperating individuals. Results from this work are expected to yield important insights into the evolution of cooperation and identify management strategies that can be used to control harmful algal blooms. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. Public lectures and a weekly radio science show are also planned.<br/><br/>Algal species that form harmful blooms produce toxins that often function allelopathically, by killing heterospecifics, decreasing interspecific competition and releasing nutrients into the water. In this way, these toxins appear to function as a 'public good' by benefiting the entire population. In Prymnesium parvum, a low-toxic 'cheater' strain has recently been isolated that has a significantly higher growth rate than toxic 'cooperator' strains both in monoculture and in mixed culture. This system offers a unique opportunity to investigate how ecological interactions may maintain cooperative allelopathy in unstructured populations. How can toxicity be maintained, if low-toxicity strains reap the benefits of toxicity while not contributing to toxin production? This question will be explored using a combination of laboratory microcosm experiments, strain culturing, and microscope observation. Specifically, mutual invasibility experiments will be used to look for intransitivity cycles between TOX+, TOX-, and a heterospecific strain in order to determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to maintenance of toxic variation in this algal species.","03/15/2017","03/15/2017","1701733","Mathew","Leibold","mleibold@mail.utexas.edu","03/15/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emlyn","Resetarits","eresetarits@utexas.edu","03/15/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Celeste Carter","Microsystems, also known as Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMS), are becoming prevalent in daily life (e.g., wearable sensors, gaming consoles, sporting gear, smart phones, medical devices, and autonomous vehicles). This trend is driven by increasing functionality, decreasing device costs, and the Internet of Things (IoT) that need billions of sensors, actuators and communications devices. Given this increasing demand for microsystems, which has been growing at double-digits annually, there is both a jobs gap and a skills gap for such technologies, as well as STEM at large. The Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME) will transition to a Support Center to work with community colleges and professional organizations to infuse microsystems educational materials into standardized job training and educational systems across several STEM disciplines. The STEM students benefit by being presented with alternative high technology microsystems career paths and having the knowledge to pursue them. <br/><br/>SCME has built a large portfolio of microsystems-based STEM educational materials and the supporting delivery infrastructure that have benefited hundreds of educators and thousands of their students. As a support center, SCME seeks to increase this impact several fold by providing asynchronous online and hands-on adaptable resources and the technical mentoring support needed for educational organizations to adopt and adapt SCME materials into their traditional STEM curricula. The SCME support center will provide a vehicle for partners to share their integration experiences and curricular modifications through conferences and online sharing opportunities. UNM will partner with the Lone Star College (LSC) system initially to pilot the introduction of microsystems into STEM courses. Historically, SCME has provided targeted professional development and microsystems courses to both Hispanic and Native American serving secondary and post-secondary institutions. SCME, with LSC and its Office of Diversity Initiatives, and student and industry professional associations, will provide scaled MEMS education, mentoring and career advisement targeted at underrepresented groups.

Because industry partners in the region are research-driven firms that depend on highly-skilled technicians to remain competitive, Westchester Community College (WCC), a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution in Valhalla, New York, has designed the Photonics and Laser Project (PAL-TEC) in response to increased regional demand for skilled technicians. Area employers anticipate a 35% increase in the number of technicians needed with knowledge and skills in photonics and optics and have made long-term commitments to the program. PAL-TEC will increase the number and quality of technicians by developing (1) a new educational pathway aligned with industry standards, (2) new teaching methods; and (3) an evidence-based, gender-inclusive recruitment and retention program. It has strong support from area industry partners that include IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bern Optics and Kent Optronics. PAL-TEC is a scalable model designed with evidence-based best practices from the NSF ATE community that can easily be adopted by other two-year colleges. The project will involve course development; professional development of faculty; development of gender-inclusive recruitment and retention plans and activities; and dissemination at national conferences and meetings of high school and college faculty and counselors. This project will establish a regional pathway to photonics careers and address the recruitment and retention of women and minorities, a long-standing challenge for the field of mechanical technology, and a growing demand for highly-skilled photonics technicians. It has the potential to significantly impact traditional enrollment patterns in mechanical technology programs at the college by introducing a new paradigm for increasing participation among women and minorities by focusing on the nature of these careers today. This project represents a strong partnership between industry, academia and high schools, addresses an unmet need in the Northeast region, and contributes to understanding how NSF ATE technical education resources can be readily adapted to meet emerging industry needs. A comprehensive evaluation will determine project effectiveness and impact. <br/><br/>This project will improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and educator development by improving curriculum, teaching methods, and faculty capacity in optics and photonics. The technologies to be taught are in use in manufacturing, data transmission, medical testing, and imaging industries. PAL-TEC will convene industry, high school, four-year, and internal partners in order to assess, design, and implement timely modifications to existing programs and to improve the diversity of the STEM technician labor force. Professional development in photonics, problem-based learning, and gender-inclusive strategies will be utilized. It will leverage expertise from the Asheville Buncombe Technical Community College (AB-Tech) ATE project, the National Center for Optics and Photonics (OP-TEC), other model institutions, and expert resources to scale quickly and effectively. WCC will work to expand use of NSF ATE resources to improve its technician education programs and share best practices with others to meet changing regional needs.

If so, women's gains in education might lead to unintended disadvantages in the labor market. Past research has found that occupations with higher proportions of women have lower average wages for both women and men. Does a similar process occur when women earn a higher proportion of college degrees? More specifically, this project seeks to improve our understanding of how the gender composition of colleges and universities may impact the value Americans assign to the four-year college degree. By examining the relationship between college completion rates of men and women and the value of the college degree, the project will enhance our understanding of the complex and unintended ways in which social progress can lead to social disadvantage. By identifying how gender progress can result in unintended labor market disadvantage, this project's findings will provide important research evidence for policymakers who wish to understand and address persistent inequality between women and men.<br/><br/>Using an original survey experiment, the research will investigate the ways in which gender composition of colleges and universities influences cultural and economic value assigned to the college degree. Accordingly, do Americans rate the cultural value of the four-year college degree lower when exposed to information that women complete college at higher rates than men? Are hiring managers less likely to hire female applicants when similarly exposed to information of women's advantage in college completion? To address these questions, the extent to which women outpace men in four-year college degree completion is experimentally manipulated to establish its causal effect on several outcomes, including perceived competency of college graduates, hiring preferences, and salary decisions. Taken together, the survey experimental designs utilized in this project advance social demographic theories on the causal mechanisms that impact gender inequality and provide compelling data that observable differences in valuation of the four-year college degree are driven by true valuation differences directly conditional on Americans's perceptions of the gender composition of colleges and universities. This research contributes to sociological inquiry by identifying and addressing emergent forms of gender inequality, as well as providing practical implications for policymakers and hiring managers alike interested in promoting gender progress at home and in the workplace.","03/15/2017","03/15/2017","1701312","Shelley","Correll","scorrell@stanford.edu","03/15/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amanda","Mireles","amireles@stanford.edu","03/15/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is a novel process for direct imprinting of dimensionally stable crystalline metal oxide nanostructures that are fabricated using soft lithography with inks comprised of crystalline nanoparticles. Via this process it is possible to create a soft daughter mold from a single parent master and use that soft mold to create successive generations of high fidelity, robust masters in crystalline zirconia and other metal oxides, substantially reducing cost. In addition the use of zirconia patterns on thermally robust master substrates enables pattern transfer at temperatures far above those accessible using conventional masters.","03/16/2017","03/16/2017","1732276","James","Watkins","watkins@polysci.umass.edu","03/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Hadley","010359450","4135450698","Research Administration Building","United States","Massachusetts","MA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Each year in the United States alone there are about 600,000 surgical procedures performed to reconstruct peripheral nerves, with costs of more than $1.7B. In moderate to severe cases of peripheral nerve injury, such as those involving nerve transections, stretch, or crush, long-term outcomes are poor. Disabilities due to nerve injury are associated with more than $7B in costs of long-term care for those affected. Add to this the economic costs of lost productivity of these individuals and the total costs are in excess of $15B per year. The proposed work seeks to further develop and validate a novel technology which can have a significant impact upon clinical care for nerve injury by both speeding and improving nerve repair.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based upon multiple years of research demonstrating that peripheral nerve tissue derived hydrogels represent an ideal environment for nerve repair. Through multiple benchtop and preclinical tests, it has been shown that delivery of such hydrogels to a site of nerve repair modulates the inflammatory response to injury, recruits cells which are supportive of nerve repair, and ultimately supports the regrowth of neurons resulting in improved functional recovery. This solution has the potential to be used in multiple nerve injury modalities including nerve crush, stretch, transection, and gap injuries as either a primary treatment or as an adjunct to surgical repair and/or nerve grafting.","03/16/2017","03/16/2017","1737721","Bryan","Brown","bryanbrown@pitt.edu","03/16/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Pittsburgh","Pittsburgh","152132303","4126247400","University Club","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Structural lattices provide the framework for the design of mechanical metamaterials with the ability to guide, steer and attenuate mechanical waves, which is relevant to applications such as vibration isolation, noise absorption, and stress wave mitigation. These properties are key to the design of novel mechanical metamaterials for wave management and impact protection. Successful achievement of the project objectives will open numerous possibilities for the characterization of a broad class of engineered materials as well as of porous, naturally occurring, or bio-inspired architected materials. The findings of the project will impact design methodologies for energy absorbing structures for body armor design, vehicle protection, and protective layers for helmets for transportation, sport and military use. Thus, the project supports fundamental investigations that will benefit research devoted to the mitigation of the effect of head injuries and concussions, or the effect of blasts. In addition, part of the project findings will be directly transferred to an educational module for an undergraduate laboratory course that will expose students to state-of-the-art mechanical characterization methodologies.<br/><br/>The dynamic behavior of structural lattices undergoing large deformations will be investigated through novel full-field measurement techniques based on digital image correlation, along with the numerical analysis of wave properties, dynamic instabilities and collapse mechanisms. Currently available digital image correlation techniques are not suitable for the estimation of displacements and strains in structures that are highly porous, i.e. with volume of voids significantly exceeding the volume occupied by material. Furthermore, these techniques are limited in their ability to track large motion during dynamic events. The project will address these challenges through the formulation of image tracking procedures that exploit the connectivity of lattices, and of a Lagrangian framework for motion tracking that takes inspiration from particle image velocimetry used in experimental fluid dynamics. The formulation and implementation of the experimental technique will enable the study of wave motion and, most notably, of the onset of instabilities, non-uniform deformations and potentially collapse. Experimental measurements will inform and validate numerical models that will then be used to estimate directions of wave motion, strain localizations and instabilities.","03/16/2017","03/16/2017","1719728","Massimo","Ruzzene","ruzzene@gatech.edu","03/16/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","1630","Mechanics of Materials and Str","022E","SOLID MECHANICS","024E","MATERIALS DESIGN","026E","STRUCTURAL MECHANICS","027E","NANOMECHANICS","7916","EAGER","9161","SINGLE DIVISION/UNIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AMPP","ADVANCED MATERIALS & PROCESSING PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To help deal with complex cybersecurity challenges, the international Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) community has published high-impact, Big Data driven cybersecurity research since 2003. Despite the many novel advances in data-driven cybersecurity research, there is no sharing platform that aggregates and provides data and tools used and developed in cybersecurity research for the larger cybersecurity community. The proposed project aims to fill this gap by developing the Cybersecurity Big Data and Analytics Sharing Platform to encourage cybersecurity researchers to share their data, tools, and analytical approaches. In addition, the project will support two Security Big Data and Analytics Sharing Workshops to engage the community in the platform development. Upon project completion, the platform will be open for access by the broad cybersecurity research and education community.<br/><br/>The proposed data sharing platform would enable the publication of high-impact, reproducible, and cutting edge research to advance scientific discoveries. Such a platform would also enhance the educational experience for cybersecurity students, specifically CyberCorps SFS students as they prepare to enter the cybersecurity workforce. The proposed project will provide value to both cybersecurity researchers and students by providing data for cutting-edge research and enhanced educational experiences.

Plant mating systems, which range from self-pollinating to outcross-pollinating, where pollen has to be moved among different plants for fertilization to happen, can have significant effects on where wild plant species live. Self-pollinating species are expected to be better than outcrossing species at colonizing new areas because they do not require the presence of either pollinators or mates. This study will test the hypothesis that self-pollinating species also have physiological advantages that allow them to outperform outcrossing species in stressful, water-limited environments. The researchers will collect and analyze a variety of physiological data, such as growth rate and relative fitness, from multiple, closely-related pairs of selfing and outcrossing Collinsia plants. Results of this work will reveal important factors influencing the evolution of plant mating systems. In addition, the project will involve mentoring of undergraduate students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. Planned outreach activities include the development of educational activities for elementary school children. <br/><br/>Recent findings support theoretical models that suggest selfing may be a niche diversifying trait because it allows colonization of new habitats lacking pollinators or mates. The proposed research builds on previous results on mating systems and niche breadth by testing whether the physiological performance of selfing species relative to outcrossers contribute to the observed repeated patterns of niche breadth differentiation between sister species pairs in the genus Collinsia. To test the hypothesis that selfers are better adapted to water-limited environments, the investigators will measure drought stress by comparing the ratio of stable isotopes 13C:12C in herbarium leaf samples of selfing/outcrossing sister species pairs relative to the 13C:12C in the international standard. They will also grow three selfing/outcrossing sister species pairs in the greenhouse in both high water and water-limited treatments and measure physiological, growth, and reproductive trait responses. Results will have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of niche breadth.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1701947","Susan","Kalisz","skalisz@utk.edu","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Tennessee Knoxville","KNOXVILLE","379960003","8659743466","1 CIRCLE PARK","United States","Tennessee","TN","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alannie-Grace","Grant","agrant11@vols.utk.edu","03/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Predation can be a major source of mortality in wild animal populations. When the risk of predation is variable, prey species are expected to show flexible developmental responses that reduce their risk of being killed by predators. For example, young birds may grow faster and leave the nest earlier when nest predation risk is high. However, flexible developmental responses at early life stages may be physiologically costly and increase mortality at later life stages. By simulating increased predation, the researchers will experimentally determine the effects of variable nest predation on nestling growth rate and timing of fledging for Dark-eyed Juncos. Each bird will be tagged with a radio transmitter to determine their fates after leaving the nest. The study will also address whether activity levels and behaviors of fledglings reduce mortality risks and compensate for physiological costs. Results will provide critical insights on the key factors that control the growth and decline of wild animal populations, and lead to more effective management of these populations. In addition, the project will involve mentoring of both undergraduate and graduate students, and will develop educational materials for high school students. Educational videos for school age children will also be created for a local science education center.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that faster growth of Dark-eyed Juncos in response to nest predation risk compromises mobility and causes increased mortality risk at older life history stages. Researchers will use speakers to broadcast sounds of typical nest predators to increase the perception of nest predation risk by parents and offspring to examine its consequences for mortality after fledging. Preliminary data show that young nestlings in 'high risk' nests leave the nest with shorter wings and are less adept at flying, but it is unclear if these same individuals are predated more often after leaving. Just before the nestlings leave the nest the researchers will attach radio transmitters to aid in tracking. Data will be collected on how often and how far the young birds move around each day after they leave the nest; whether they hide more often in denser vegetation where predators, like hawks, have greater difficulty getting to them; and whether they actually are more likely to die. Results will advance our understanding of carryover effects from growth plasticity on offspring mortality during later life stages.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1701672","Thomas","Martin","tom.martin@umontana.edu","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Montana","Missoula","598120001","4062436670","32 CAMPUS DRIVE MAIN HALL","United States","Montana","MT","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"James","Mouton","james.mouton@umontana.edu","03/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The hard shells of insects, shrimp and their relatives are made from chitin. But chitin is a natural polymer made by connecting a series of sugar-like molecules that now appears to be produced by many soft bodied animals. The proposed research examines the biology of chitin in the group containing corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish. Like other species in this group the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, lacks any hard body parts that would be obviously made of chitin. However, the genomes of these anemones have three genes that code for a chitin-producing enzyme. This research will investigate the distribution of chitin in these soft-bodied animals. The research will determine if chitin has an integral and unexpected role in the development of these organisms. Ultimately, this research will advance our understanding of how animals evolve novel structures using glycopolymers. This research will also provide training for a graduate student and foster outreach efforts for Girls in Science programs and mentorship of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>Chitin's role in animal development and regeneration has not been widely explored, though prior work suggests that glycopolymers may have a widespread role in cell behavior and migration. Preliminary data show that chitin is present in cnidarian stinging cells (cnidae), as well as soft tissues. This study will survey the diversity of chitin synthase (CHS) genes across the cnidarians. The goal is to determine shared and lineage-specific changes to CHS genes that may correlate to diverse roles of chitin. Dozens of species of cnidarians from five cnidarian classes will be surveyed. Animals will be identified to species level and tissue collected from different tissue types. RNA will be Isolated and used to provide tissue specific profiles of which CHS genes are expressed in which tissues. Variation in the pattern of gene expression across species and tissues will allow inference of the evolutionary diversification of chitin as structural or nonstructural compound.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1701082","Chris","Amemiya","camemiya@benaroyaresearch.org","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","7378","EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lauren","Vandepas","lvandepa@uw.edu","03/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elekonich","Why cooperation evolves and how it persists in groups of organisms is a question that biologists are still working to answer. This research will investigate if limited nutrition has led to and continues to promote increased cooperation in one of nature's greatest cooperators: the social insects. The project will integrate behavioral, genetic, and physiological research to investigate how nutrition limitation affects cooperation in two species - one with simple societies (paper wasps) and one with complex societies (honey bees). In experimental colonies of both these organisms, the diets of developing workers will be altered such that some individuals will experience nutritional stress and others will receive normal healthy diets. When these workers reach adulthood, the researchers will examine how cooperatively they behave (more or less aggression toward other workers, tending the queen, raising their sisters), testing the hypothesis that decreased nutritional resources promote increased cooperation. By comparing simple and complex social insect societies, this research will examine whether resource limitation could be a general theme in the evolution of cooperation. By analyzing ovary size, fattiness, and the activity of reproduction and nutrition related genes in starved and un-starved individuals, this research will also examine how nutrition can influence differences in behavior through physiology and gene expression. Research will be paired with insect and evolution education outreach via public talks and freely available and entertaining internet content, as well as direct participation in research activities by undergraduates and research assistants of diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>An essential form of cooperation in a social insect colony is between the queen (the sole reproductive in the colony) and her workers (the queen's daughters). Worker honey bees vary in their responsiveness to the queen a behavior that is essential to colony social cohesion. Nutritionally stressed workers exhibit a high sensitivity to the queen, and workers with high nutrition diets exhibit a low sensitivity. The researchers will investigate if mechanisms underlying the link between nutrition and cooperation are evolutionarily conserved by studying elements of nutritional and reproductive physiology and associated molecular pathways in two eusocial insects, honey bees and paper wasps. They will expand this prior work on honey bees to address whether nutritional stress-induced increases in queen responsiveness are underlain by changes in the regulation of conserved genes related to reproduction and nutrient signaling. Second, the researchers will utilize the primitively social paper wasp Polistes metricus to begin to address the generality and evolutionary conservation of this pattern. Polistes workers will be nutritionally restricted and behavioral observations will be recorded to test whether this leads to higher social cohesion of workers on the nest. The researchers will also measure how these changes affect ovary development and changes in the expression of genes associated with reproduction and nutrient signaling. If nutritionally restricted Polistes workers exhibit higher cooperative behavior, then the connection between nutritional stress and cooperation may represent a conserved mechanism regulating social cohesion in insect societies. Cooperation may be strategic when nutrition is scarce, and the link between nutritional stress and cooperation may be a common theme in social evolution.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1701887","Amy","Toth","amytoth@iastate.edu","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Iowa State University","AMES","500112207","5152945225","1138 Pearson","United States","Iowa","IA","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alexander","Walton","awalton@iastate.edu","03/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, predators attacking highly coordinated fish schools have little success due to how efficient information transmission is in the group. The technological challenges of filming and tracking large groups of animals have limited our understanding of how they are so effective at predator avoidance, but recent advances in computer vision and high-speed filming now allow us to accurately recreate these information transmission networks and show how information moves through animal groups. Insights into these networks have put forth predictions that are at odds with long-established hypotheses on where in the group animals are safest: classic behavioral ecology theory suggests the center, while new network data suggests the edge of the group. The research carried out here will for the first time test these competing hypotheses. Live interactions between a northern pike predator and schools of golden shiners will be filmed in the laboratory and then recreated from a sensory network perspective using sophisticated computer vision software to better understand how information is transferred and the ramifications of individual location in the group. The experiment will provide insights into the fields of behavioral ecology, sensory ecology, game theory, and network science. It will provide scientific and statistical training to graduate and undergraduate students, and findings will be disseminated at scientific conferences, through blogging, and through science outreach to local high schools.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>For decades, Hamilton's Selfish Herd theory has served as the expectation for the spatial distribution of predation risk in animal groups. In this model, cohesive grouping emerges as animals move to position other individuals between themselves and a potential hidden predator, hence minimizing their ""domain of danger"". Support for this theory has been mixed for mobile animal groups such as fish schools, however, because the Selfish Herd theory does not allow for prey to respond to the predator. Real predator-prey interactions, on the other hand, are dynamic. Until very recently, directly testing Hamilton's Selfish Herd theory in fish schools has been impossible due to technological limitations on the quality and quantity of behavior data. Recent advances in computer vision and high-speed cameras, however, now allow for accurate measures of the fine-scale movements of all members of fish schools, as well as estimations of the visual information available to them. Networks constructed from this visual information are an accurate predictor of how movement decisions transfer through schools of fish. Here research will directly test the non-exclusive hypotheses of whether spatial positioning or network structure is a more accurate predictor of mortality risk by filming predator-prey interactions between golden shiners and a northern pike predator in the laboratory.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1701289","Daniel","Rubenstein","dir@princeton.edu","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

Efforts have been mounted to eradicate the mosquito vectors; however, some of these efforts, including insecticide sprays, have been viewed with skepticism by local communities due to limited knowledge and inconsistent information concerning the fate of the insecticide and the subsequent ecological and human health impacts. Thus, there are growing concerns about the human health and ecological impacts of insecticide spraying, especially Naled spraying in Miami. Those against Naled's use emphasize that Naled has negative health and ecosystem impacts impacting honeybees and birds and was banned by the European Union in 2012. Those proposing continued use of Naled cite studies that suggest it is safe to use according to specifications (in ultra-low volume). The objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the environmental fate of Naled by conducting laboratory-controlled experiments supplemented by full-scale opportunistic monitoring during aerial spray activities.<br/><br/>Specifically, this study will evaluate the impact of soil and water on the persistence of Naled and its by-product, Dichlorvos, both of which have insecticidal properties. The laboratory study will be supplemented with sampling conducted before and after the spray of Naled in the coming summer season, to identify potential areas of accumulation within the coastal intertidal zone. The PI's team will evaluate the persistence of environmental insecticides; specifically, they will evaluate the impacts of sediment properties on the fate of Naled and Dichlorvos and assess whether the intertidal zone serves as a reservoir of insecticide accumulation. The existing literature sheds little light on the fate of Naled and degradation by-products in natural settings. Moreover, scant data are available on the impacts of environmental matrices, especially sediments, on the persistence of Naled. The PI will evaluate Naled as a model organophosphate insecticide which is currently the insecticide of choice for Zika larvae eradication. They hypothesize that the persistence of Naled in the environment varies across environmental media, e.g., shorter persistence in beach sands than the soils with higher organic content. They further hypothesize that Naled from the aerial sprays in coastal areas will accumulate in the intertidal zone, allowing for potential exposures nearshore. Results from this study can be used to quantify decay rates for Naled under different soil conditions. These decay rates will be validated against measurements collected during full-scale spray activities. Results can be incorporated into fate and transport models that simulate Naled persistence in the environment. The Miami-Dade community will benefit from the translation of the knowledge gained from this project to mosquito control decisions by Miami-Dade County's Mosquito Control Division, and from assessments of human health risks by the Miami-Dade Department of Health.","03/17/2017","03/17/2017","1709939","Helena","Solo-Gabriele","hmsolo@miami.edu","03/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Miami","CORAL GABLES","331462926","3052843924","1320 S.

Experimental methods for discovering the neural basis of behavior have been advancing rapidly and, as a result, brain data sets are increasing in size and complexity. Methods for better understanding such rich data sets, which can enable design of ever-more informative experiments, are desperately needed. This workshop series is concerned with identifying, discussing, and disseminating many of the most promising approaches to analysis of neural data of all kinds. It also encourages young researchers, including graduate students, to present their work; exposes young researchers to important challenges and opportunities in this interdisciplinary domain, while providing a small meeting atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young researchers with senior colleagues; and includes as participants women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities, who might benefit from the small workshop environment.<br/><br/>The data discussed in this workshop range from anatomy to electrophysiology, to neuroimaging. Cross-disciplinary communication between experimental neuroscientists and those trained in statistical and computational methods is a priority. SAND8 will bring together neurophysiologists, statisticians, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and computer scientists who are interested in quantitative analysis of neural data. SAND8 will begin with a morning-long panel discussion on ""Emerging Challenges of Brain Science Data,"" and end with several talks that connect statistical analysis to mathematical modeling. In between there will be keynote talks by senior investigators and shorter presentations by junior investigators, the latter selected on a competitive basis. There will also be a poster session, to which all participants are invited to contribute. Talks and posters may involve new methodology, investigation of existing methods, or application of state-of-the-art analytical techniques. In addition, there will be a lunchtime discussion devoted to opportunities and challenges for women in computational neuroscience.

The project provides direct measures of innovation and research and development (R&D), firm-level labor and total factor productivity, the dispersion of firm productivity and performance, the growth of high- vs. low-productivity entrants and incumbents, and exit rates of under-performing firms. With a specific focus on the Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) and 504 loan facilities, the analysis provides evidence on the importance of financial constraints, and the degree to which they may be attenuated by major government programs. The results will shed light not only on direct program impacts but also consider the indirect effects on productivity-enhancing reallocation of resources. In particular the central issue as to whether the policy intervention promotes growth of productive but financially constrained businesses, or instead sustains low-productivity firms that should release their resources to superior uses. The results have policy implications for the growth, innovation, and productivity of the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>The project relies on new concepts, methods, and data for estimating the effects of financial access and small business programs. Conceptually, the project draws on models of firm dynamics to analyze innovation as the result of experimentation by entrants and incumbents, thus as part of the creative destruction process. A fundamental insight is that the full distribution of outcomes is useful for revealing innovation, as experimentation raises dispersion and selection raises skewness. The empirical methods include a credible identification strategy based on panel-matching and instrumental variables capturing geographic variation in SBA loan access. Estimation includes not only average treatment effects for productivity and innovation measures but also other moments of the outcome distribution: overall dispersion and skewness, performance at top percentiles, and allocation and selection effects that work through growth and exit at different points in the distribution. The methods provide an original way to assess the impact of a government intervention on productivity-enhancing reallocation. The data work links SBA administrative data with Census Bureau universal data on all U.S. employers. Variables from the Business Register, Census of Manufacturers, and Annual Survey of Manufacturers are added to measure productivity. Linking to the new Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs permits direct measurement of innovation and R&D effort. The conceptual approach, identification strategy, methods of analysis, and data development of this project should have positive externalities for other research including the evaluation of other programs in the U.S. and around the world.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1719201","John","Earle","earle@gmu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","George Mason University","FAIRFAX","220304422","7039932295","4400 UNIVERSITY DR","United States","Virginia","VA","7626","SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY","7626","SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In general, the community of cyberinfrastructure processionals, which includes the targeted sub community, is trained in an ad-hoc fashion. There is a constant pull from industry to hire away such critical personnel, which specially impacts smaller institutions with staff and training issues. There are plans for recruitment from diverse backgrounds and institutions. This critical aspect of this workshop will address better participation and training of underserved community for this emerging profession. This is also expected to foster similar coordination networks and training activities. The workshop will be collocated at Super Computing conference (SC-16); thus is will impact and benefit from the SC attendees. Such training activities are aligned with the presidential NSCI initiative on workforce development of scientific workforce in high performance computing, and serve the NSF's mission in promoting preparedness to advance science. <br/><br/>The workshop will seek to identify community needs and appropriate training material, creating a critical community network, and developing a roadmap for long term strategy. Most educational institutions have relatively small research computing support staff and typically recruit their new staff from their user community. These staff are given on-the-job training to learn the specialized skills of research computing. Because of the small staff size, however, the loss of a single individual makes a significant change on the workload of the remaining skilled individuals. There is rarely a local expert remaining with whom to apprentice, as small staffs limit skill redundancy options. This workshop will gather experts from across the US, representing leaders of research computing centers, system administrators, educational programs, and other national coordination activities related to research computing, and discuss possible methods of addressing this shortage of trained research computing professionals. One of the goals is also to prevent the sense of professional isolation so common among smaller research computing centers' staffs, particularly in times of travel restrictions.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1738249","Dane","Skow","dane@skowfamily.org","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","7361","EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE","026Z","NSCI: National Strategic Computing Initi","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spengler","This CAREER project will advance the state of the art in supervised machine learning to allow for incomplete, uncertain and unspecific label information. Supervised machine learning algorithms produce desired outputs for given input data by learning from example training data. The methods generally rely on completely and accurately labeled training data to drive the learning algorithm. However, many applications are plagued with labels that are incomplete, uncertain, and unspecific (lack precision). Current techniques do not adequately handle such data.<br/><br/>For example, analysis of satellite imagery to identify the content of each pixel is often conducted by coupling unsupervised learning methods (that do not rely on labeled training data) with manual exploration. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Imagine, instead, easy-to-use tools that could understand the content of each pixel in satellite imagery. Extremely large amounts of road map data (for example from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) and social media information (for example geo-tagged photographs, video clips, and social networking posts) are continually collected and stored. These data could be used as sparsely-labeled training data (with varying degrees of specificity and uncertainty) to guide understanding of satellite imagery.<br/><br/>Although the data is available, algorithms have yet to be developed to combine these data sources and identify the content of pixels in satellite images. This work will advance this and other potential applications of machine learning where incomplete, uncertain and unspecific labels in training data challenge the development of effective machine learning algorithms. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will achieve these advances through the following research objectives:<br/>(1) Investigate and develop a mathematical framework and associated algorithms for Multiple Instance Function Learning that addresses linear and non-linear classification and regression problems with varying levels and types of sparsity, uncertainty, and specificity in training labels.<br/><br/>(2) Study and apply the proposed framework and algorithms towards the fusion of satellite imagery, road map data and social media for global scene understanding. <br/><br/>This research will be conducted in conjunction with integrated education and outreach activities. In particular, an interactive web application will be developed to provide an avenue for introducing concepts from machine learning and remote sensing to the public for dissemination and outreach. This interactive web application will also be used, along with additional hands-on activities, to introduce high school students to machine learning and remote sensing concepts during an annual summer engineering camp held at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Paired with the web application will be a research website in which data, code, publications and presentations will be shared with the research community. Furthermore, undergraduate and graduate research assistants will be trained in the areas of machine learning and remote sensing. Finally, relevant research topics will be introduced in the PI's undergraduate and graduate courses.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1723891","Alina","Zare","azare@ece.ufl.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","7364","INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Strigolactones comprise a family of plant hormones that regulate shoot branching, root architecture, and cambial growth. Strigolactones also trigger germination of the highly destructive parasitic weeds, broomrape and witchweed, and promote symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which karrikins and strigolactones control plant growth may enable a new wave of innovation in crop development and weed control.<br/><br/>Plants recognize both karrikins and strigolactones through a genetic pathway that requires the F-box protein MAX2. F-box proteins have central roles in several plant hormone signaling systems, and act by targeting specific protein substrates for degradation. The targets of MAX2 have long remained elusive and as such represent a critical roadblock to understanding the mechanism of karrikin and strigolactone signaling. A genetic screen has now led to the identification of a candidate target, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), which regulates seed germination and seedling growth. SMAX1 is a member of an uncharacterized family of eight genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this project genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to determine 1) how other genes in the SMAX1 family contribute to plant development; 2) the molecular function and regulation of SMAX1 protein; and 3) the protein interacting partners of SMAX1 and MAX2. These experiments will reveal how the SMAX1 family acts in karrikin and strigolactone signaling and whether SMAX1 is a target of MAX2. <br/><br/>A postdoctoral researcher,graduate student, and several undergraduates will be trained for careers in science-related fields. Two projects will be initiated to improve undergraduate retention in science-related careers and enhance K-12 STEM education.

Mishkind","How do cells sense and establish communication with other cells in order to allow for beneficial or compatible interactions as opposed to harmful interactions? Plant pollination is an excellent system for gaining insight into this question because intercellular communication between male and female tissues is critical for the recognition of compatible pollen. In plants a pollen tube (PT) grows from a pollen grain that has landed on the surface of a flower's female reproductive tissue. The tube extends through that tissue towards the egg-containing ovary. Upon entering the ovary the tube stops growing and bursts open, releasing sperm that fertilize an egg, which in turn develops into a seed. In order to deliver the sperm cells to the ovary, the PT must sense that it has arrived at the right place and change from tip-growth to explosive release of the sperm it contains. This project seeks to determine the molecular signals that communicate to a PT that it has entered the ovary and must stop growing and release its sperm. <br/><br/>Female gametophytic mutations in FERONIA (FER), a receptor-like kinase, and NORTIA (NTA), a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of 7-transmembrane proteins, cause PTs to continue growing inside of the receptive synergid instead of rupturing to release the sperm, indicating that these genes form part of a signaling network. This project is aimed at further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms used for communication between the synergid and PT during PT reception, using NTA as the anchor molecule. Synergids are highly specialized cells whose sole function is to communicate with PTs. Experiments will be performed to define the cell biology of the synergid cells before, during and after PT reception and to determine which domains are necessary for NTA localization and function and to determine how NTA fits into the dynamic cellular changes that occur during PT reception. The second goal of the project is to identify new members of the PT reception pathway and determine how they act in the signaling pathway. Enhancer and suppressor mutants of the gene nta will be characterized for roles in PT reception and NTA will be used as bait in yeast-2-hybrid screens to identify other members of the pathway. The results of this project will provide a clearer picture of the signaling pathway involved in PT reception and may also be transformative in our understanding of how self/non-self recognition takes place. A graduate student, post-doc, and undergraduate student will be trained in the fields of plant genetics and cell biology during this project. Students in a cell biology lab taught by the Principal Investigator will investigate proteins that are predicted to be involved in PT reception in an inquiry-based lab module and an outreach program will be conducted to encourage rural Oklahoma high schools to incorporate plant science research in their curricula.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1733865","Sharon","Kessler","sakessler@ou.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Purdue University","West Lafayette","479072114","7654941055","Young Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","7656","SYMBIOSIS DEF & SELF RECOG","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9150",NA,NA,NA,"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This question is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, but has been very difficult to answer. A major problem is that current analytical approaches, known as phylogenetic comparative methods, require that a single value be used to represent a trait for an entire species. As a result, valuable information on differences among individuals within a species can't be used. This limits the types of questions that these comparative methods can address. The main goal of this project is to develop new analytical software that accounts for trait variation within species, which will result in a much more powerful computational tool. The newly developed software will be tested using experimental data from salamanders and fish. This award will have multiple broader impacts. This new tool will let a whole new set of hypotheses be tested and will be widely used by scientists doing evolutionary ecology research. Undergraduate students will receive hands-on training in mathematical modeling and software development. Educational outreach activities include a research-education exchange between a regional undergraduate university and a large research university. National and international teaching workshops will help train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.<br/><br/>Analyses of phenotypic data tend to remain distinctly different enterprises between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. Consequently, we still do not know how microevolutionary trends from ecological selection associate to macroevolutionary trends across phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) measure the amount of phylogenetic signal in a set of data or account for the phylogenetic relatedness among observations when evaluating ecological variation, but currently work only with single values for species. Thus, large amounts of within-species data are disregarded when using PCMs, which limits their inferential capability. This project will develop an analytical solution to this problem, and provide a framework for extending PCMs to large data sets comprising microevolutionary data. The methods developed will allow scientists to evaluate the consistency of small-scale and large scale evolutionary relationships in a comparative framework. This project will incorporate both theoretical and empirical components. Statistical research will evaluate the statistical power and inferential error rates of ""expanded-PCM"" to varied analytical designs, phenotypic variables, tree topologies, and data balance. These methods will be applied empirically to two vertebrate systems to study the phylogenetic relatedness of intra-species morphological variation, as it is associated with intra- and interspecific ecological variation. Several educational outreach activities will also be conducted, including: a research-in-education exchange between a primarily undergraduate university and large research university, and teaching workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1737895","Michael","Collyer","m.collyer@chatham.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Chatham College","Pittsburgh","152322826","4123651160","Woodland Road","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9229","RES IN UNDERGRAD INST-RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7377",NA,NA,NA,"EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many species in nature have multiple color morphs that occur together within a single population. However, the frequencies at which particular morphs occur can vary widely among different populations. A fundamental unanswered question in evolutionary ecology is whether natural selection or dispersal is primarily driving these differences. This study will collect and analyze genomic data from 32 Eastern Red-backed Salamander populations that range from having only a single color morph present to having both morphs present at various frequencies. Different morphs of this species also differ in other aspects of their biology, such as physiology and aggression, and a major goal is to assess the relative importance of local adaptation versus dispersal among populations in maintaining morph frequencies. Results will further our basic understanding of the relationship between color variation and the evolution of diversity. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, who will be trained in cutting-edge genetic techniques. Outreach includes public seminars at two local nature preserves and educational displays at the local library for school children.<br/><br/>This project will use genomic data to determine whether geographic distance, environmental variables, morph frequency, or a combination of these factors best explain patterns of genetic variation in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Genetic data will be collected using double digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD). These data will be used to quantify levels of gene flow in P. cinereus from 480 individuals from 32 populations across northern Ohio that vary in morph frequency, from monomorphic to various degrees of polymorphic. A variety of statistical analyses, such as STRUCTURE, BAYESCAN, and redundancy analysis, will be used to determine if genetic variation in P. cinereus is more closely linked with phenotype frequency or geographic distance. Overall, this study will provide critical information on the relative contributions of morph frequency and geographic distance for explaining patterns of genetic variation in P. cinereus, and will improve our understanding of the factors involved in the evolution and maintenance of color polymorphisms.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701680","Shawn","Kuchta","kuchta@ohio.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Ohio University","ATHENS","457012979","7405932857","108 CUTLER HL","United States","Ohio","OH","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Maggie","Hantak","mh433113@ohio.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ideas and techniques from combinatorics are increasingly being used in other areas of pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry and representation theory, as well as applied areas such as mathematical physics and complexity theory. The central theme of this project is to adapt definitions of classical types of objects in algebraic combinatorics, usually defined perhaps only for partitions or the complete graph, to apply to general diagrams or graphs. Often studying this generalized setting reveals geometric and algebraic connections of which only a shadow is visible in the original setting.<br/><br/>This project includes several directions for research. One direction of study is to investigate the structural relationships between Specht modules for general diagrams, the cohomology classes of diagram Schubert varieties, and the geometry of matching ensemble polytopes. Another topic is to investigate certain weighted lattice point sums on flow polytopes of graphs, which in the case of the complete graph are related to the combinatorics of parking functions and the Hilbert series of the space of diagonal harmonics. A third topic is to study various generalizations of Schubert polynomials from a geometric and representation-theoretic perspective.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1700302","Ricky","Liu","riliu@ncsu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the importance of biofilm structure as an essential mediator of biofilm growth and activity, little is known about the relationship between biofilm structure and mechanical properties that control retention of biomass in biofilms. To address this knowledge gap, the PIs propose to develop a novel methodology, termed Optical Coherence Elastography, for rapid quantitative 3D mapping of mechanical properties in biofilms.<br/><br/>The project team will develop the Optical Coherence Elastography method and use it to assay properties and dynamics of mixed-culture biofilms representative of those employed for biological nitrogen (N) removal. Efforts will be organized around two specific objectives: 1) Develop a dynamic Optical Coherence Elastography method for mesoscale nondestructive mapping of elastic moduli in environmental biofilms; and, 2) Employ Optical Coherence Elastography to quantify the relationship between mesoscale biofilm mechanical properties, morphology, and performance in mixed culture N-cycling biofilms. Initial applications of Optical Coherence Elastography will relate mesoscale gradients in Young's and Shear moduli to variation in biofilm roughness, internal porosity and thickness. Nondestructive elastography will enable time-series measurement of mesoscale structural and mechanical features during development of these essential environmental biofilms. Thus, this project advances understanding of critical yet poorly understood interrelationships between physical structure and mechanical properties in environmental biofilms. Macroscale biofilm characteristics such as biomass accumulation and chemical transformation rates are known to be linked to mesoscale biofilm structure and mechanical properties, yet the vast majority of work on biofilm structure has focused on the microscale. Optical Coherence Elastography will enable, for the first time, co-located, real-time, non-invasive, in situ mapping of biofilm morphology and mechanical properties at the mesoscale. The proposed Optical Coherence Elastography methodology employs a shear wave transducer to propagate localized deformations in biofilms. Deformations are then continuously imaged via phase sensitive optical coherence tomography. The spatially resolved mesoscale biofilm mechanical property distribution is obtained by relating the speed of propagation of deformations to local density and elastic or viscoelastic properties. Optical Coherence Elastography has recently been applied for biomedical research, but is an entirely new approach to biofilm characterization. Results of the proposed work will open new possibilities to elucidate the interplay between mesoscale biofilm properties, microscale biofilm composition, and emergent system function in environmental biofilms. This project will support one Ph.D. student and as undergraduate student. Project experimental systems will be used to design experiments for a core laboratory course at Northwestern and demonstrations for outreach to K-12 students and community groups.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701105","Aaron","Packman","a-packman@northwestern.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1440","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oluwaseyi","Balogun","o-balogun@northwestern.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"George","Wells","george.wells@northwestern.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Online reviews have become an important resource for public opinion sharing. They influence our decisions over an extremely wide spectrum of daily and professional activities: e.g., where to eat, where to stay, which products to purchase, which doctors to see, which books to read, which universities to attend, and so on. However, the credibility and trustworthiness of online reviews are at stake. It is well known that a large body of reviews is fabricated -- either by owners, competitors, or entities paid by those -- to create false perception on the actual quality of the products and services. What is more, opinion fraud is prevalent; while credit card fraud is as rare as 0.2% or less, it is estimated that 20-30% of the reviews on well-known service sites could be fake. This poses a serious risk to businesses and the public, from investing on a low-quality product to consulting an incompetent doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Like other kinds of fraud, opinion fraud is a serious legal offense. In fact, it is currently being recognized as a serious issue in law enforcement by policymakers. Thus solving this problem is of great importance to businesses and the general public alike. Accurately spotting opinion fraud will enable site owners to provide trustworthy content, maintain the integrity of their service, and protect the online citizens from unfair (or potentially harmful) products and services. Businesses will also benefit from reviews with reliable feedback. Honest businesses will be indirectly rewarded, as it will no longer be easy for unscrupulous businesses to benefit from fake reviews. The research outcomes will thus contribute significantly to the healthy growth of the Internet commerce. Educational activities include incorporating research findings in graduate level courses, educating public on fraudulent behavior and misinformation, and providing publicly available educational materials including lectures and manuscripts.<br/><br/>Given the critical issues of opinion fraud in online communities, how can one identify fake reviews and attribute responsible culprits behind them? By conjoining expertise of the PIs over various modalities of deception footprints ranging over language, user behavior, and relational information, this project presents a research program that will result in much needed solutions to this emergent, prevalent, and socially impactful problem. The ultimate goal is to create a unified detection framework via synergistic integration of multiple information sources; from linguistics, user behavior, and network effects, to obtain the best of all worlds. The main idea is to formulate the problem as a relational inference task on composite heterogeneous networks, providing a principled, extensible approach that can blend and reinforce all the above cues towards effective and robust detection of fraud. From a scientific point of view, the research brings together three disciplines: natural language analysis, behavioral modeling, and graph mining. The outcome is a suite of novel, principled, and scalable techniques and models that will enhance our understanding of the creation and dissemination of opinion fraud and misinformation in general at a large scale. The PIs will collaborate with industry partners such as Yelp, Google, and Amazon, directly solicit online fake reviews, and conduct well-designed user studies for testing and validation of their techniques.

The conference is the co-located 2017 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the 45th Annual North American Manufacturing Research Conference sponsored by the North American Manufacturing Research Institution of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. This conference will take place from June 4-7, 2017 and is hosted by the University of Southern California. This is the ideal venue for the workshop, which is designed to identify bold visions for the manufacturing sector more than ten years in the future, and to identify the required basic research needed to achieve that bold vision. These two leading conferences in the Manufacturing Engineering field act as global bridges between industries, government laboratories, and academic institutions. Blue Skies Activities will include: 1) Brief introductory presentations by Workshop organizers and others; 2) Presentations by 6 ,8 manufacturing thought leaders; 3) Interactions among workshop participants, NSF program directors, Manufacturing thought leaders, and staff of the interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office. The speakers will be selected from one-page abstracts; their travel to the workshop will be supported by the award. A panel of judges will evaluate the presentations and decide upon a winner. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has pledged to introduce a new society-level award, the David Dornfeld Manufacturing Vision Award, to the best presentation. The workshop, expected to be attended by at least 80 attendees of the conference, is intended to be the first instance of an annual event that will help articulate and develop a broad manufacturing vision, and to catalyze support for that vision. The vision will be a useful resource for policy makers, federal funding agencies, companies developing their own manufacturing strategies, university researchers, and others.<br/><br/>The support will cover (1) the registration fees, and (2) the travel fees for the speakers and PIs. The call for abstracts is disseminated through the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers; the submitted applications go through a selection process by the conference committee. The highest rated applications will be invited to give full presentations. After the conference, a summary of the Blue Skies visions will be published as a North American Manufacturing Research Institute white paper.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1736158","K.

On one hand, the red coloration may be assessed by potential partners during mate-choice, where individuals with the brightest red color are more likely to be chosen as a mate. Evidence supports this idea in animals such as birds and fish. On the other hand, some research has found that red color may have a physiological function, for example, acting as a sunscreen that offers protection from potentially damaging solar radiation. This project uses copepods, tiny shrimp-like animals with bright red colors, to test whether to examine if red copepod color is (1) a signal of mate quality, (2) a sunscreen, or (3) both a signal of quality and a sunscreen. The results of this research will advance the basic understanding of animal coloration in group of animals that has not been well studied. In addition, the researchers will use this study system to bring science training to Alabama children in fourth through sixth grade. Working through a well-structured program--Getting Under The Surface (GUTS)--teams of parents and children from some of the most science-deficient school systems in the U.S. will be invited to half-day programs run by faculty. Two programs will be run involving the same student/parent teams. The bright red copepod system is ideal for capturing the attention of younger students while offering opportunities for training with microscopes and basic experimental design. <br/><br/>Red carotenoid coloration is a widespread form of ornamentation in animals and extensive empirical data show that red coloration is an honest signal of individual quality and performance. However, the most popular vertebrate systems that clearly demonstrate selection for red carotenoid coloration via mate choice are not suitable for the physiological experiments needed to advance the field. The project focuses on physiological constraints on the production of red carotenoids in animals, using Tigriopus copepods as a model. The researchers use diet manipulations to vary carotenoid coloration and to test whether red colors in copepods are used as a visual signal in male and female mate choice, or whether red coloration acts as a protectant against UV radiation. This behavioral research will create a critical context for interpreting physiological research on carotenoid color production and enable better of understanding red coloration in copepods in particular and animals in general.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701827","Geoffrey","Hill","ghill@acesag.auburn.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Auburn University","Auburn University","368490001","3348444438","310 Samford Hall","United States","Alabama","AL","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ryan","Weaver","rjw0019@auburn.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How this signal diversity came about and why animals use more than one trait to communicate has long interested scientists. To understand why and how this diversity in multiple signaling traits evolved, we are studying hummingbird iridescent plumage and exaggerated courtship displays. Iridescent coloration is angle-dependent and hummingbirds can easily manipulate the color observed as they behaviorally display. The PIs are exploring how the surface and internal structures of iridescent feathers co-evolved with courtship displays (shuttles) across hummingbird species. The PIs work combines measurements of micro- and nano-scale structural morphology with behavioral ecology and evolutionary theory, allowing the PIs to understand hummingbird communication from the behavior down to feather architecture. Additionally, the PIs will collect data on hummingbird mating and courtship biology, especially in terms of how hummingbirds use their environment while courting, which could prove useful to future conservation efforts. Additionally, recent work on the structure of iridescent butterfly wing scales has helped the development of more efficient solar panels. The PIs work on the angle-dependent nanostructures of hummingbird feathers could further help improve solar panel efficiency through a better understanding of how biological materials directionally reflect specific wavelengths of light.<br/><br/>Technical paragraph<br/>Animals exhibit a great diversity of ornamental traits and display behaviors, and many animals possess multiple such traits that they use to communicate. Previous work has explained the diversity in these traits by examining how they evolved in relation to the environment; however these traits can also interact with each other as they are displayed, which will further shape their evolutionary history. The PIs are testing how interactions between ornamental traits, display behaviors, and environment influence the diversity of these traits through a comparative study on several species in the bee hummingbird tribe. Bee hummingbirds are ideal for this type of study because they possess two types of conspicuous visual traits - iridescent plumage coloration and stereotyped courtship displays (shuttles) - that vary across species. Iridescent coloration is angle-dependent, such that the observed color changes depending upon the feather structure and viewing/lighting angles. Thus, perceived coloration is the result of interactions between behavioral displays, the environment, and the micro- and nanostructures of iridescent feathers. The PIs are currently studying the complex interactions between these factors in several hummingbird species to understand how each species produces a specific color that is perceived by a receiver, and how this varies interspecifically. The PIs are expanding this work by evaluating how variation in iridescent micro- and nanostructure of feathers helped shaped the evolutionary relationships between bee hummingbird plumage, display, and environment. This work allows the PIs to study how hummingbird communication evolved at multiple levels, from behaviors to nanostructure of their ornaments.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1702016","Kevin","McGraw","kevin.mcgraw@asu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Richard","Simpson","rksimps1@asu.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study utilizes existing data and archived biospecimens from a long-term field study of a gregarious mammal with a social structure permitting comparisons among status classes to assess effects of the early social environment on temperament and fitness. Effects of the early environment to be assessed include quality of maternal care, peer interactions and social status. Available data and specimens permit exploration of relationships among the early social environment, mechanisms of gene expression, circulating stress hormones, individual temperament, and longevity. The methods employed include high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing techniques, bioinformatics and advanced statistical methods. Broader impacts of this work include a deeper understanding of social and molecular determinants of adverse stress phenotypes. Ultimately, characterization of the early life social factors that shape adult stress phenotypes in free-living, gregarious mammals will facilitate generalization of the research findings to other social species, including our own. In addition to supporting the scientific work above, this project will facilitate a workshop series on research methods and data analysis designed specifically for members of the African Graduate Student Association at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>Social experiences early in life have lasting effects on adult temperament and stress phenotype, often through epigenetic modification of genes, and thus patterns of gene expression, that coordinate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Using data from the MSU Mara Hyena Project, a 28-year study of free-living, gregarious hyenas in Kenya, this proposal will investigate how social factors relate to adverse stress phenotypes, and elucidate the extent to which this relationship is mediated by DNA methylation. Funding from this project will support two research goals. First, this proposal will use Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the hyena genome that are associated with high vs. low stress phenotypes based on assessment of adult hyena temperament and stress hormones, as well as differences in early social experiences including maternal rank, maternal care, and interactions with clan mates. DMRs that are predictive of the adult stress phenotypes will be identified using Mixed Model Association for Count data via data Augmentation. The second goal is to use mediation analysis to assess whether the identified socially-induced, stress-related epigenetic pathways mediate the effect of early experience on longevity. Findings from this work will improve mechanistic understanding of how social factors affect behavioral and physiological stress phenotypes in an important new animal model. Because a proximate epigenetic mechanism (DNA methylation) is assessed in relation to an ultimate consequence (fitness), this work represents a large step forward in terms of understanding the role of epigenetics in evolution - a concept that has been largely unexplored.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701384","Kay","Holekamp","holekamp@msu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zachary","Laubach","laubachz@msu.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This will make scientific research cheaper, faster, more reliable, and more reproducible.<br/><br/>The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) standard is a container format for scientific data.

An emerging area of concern is with endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), which are synthetic or natural compounds that infiltrate habitats in a variety of ways and wreak havoc on functions of the body that aid in survival and reproduction. Oftentimes, behavior is the first thing to change following EDC exposure, but what does it mean when behavior does not change? Frequently this is interpreted as EDCs not having an impact on the individual, but there are many alternative explanations that might provide a greater understanding of how animals cope with environmental stressors. The goal of this research is to determine if animals that are exposed to EDCs maintain their behavior by altering patterns of hormone production, and whether the measures that animals use to counteract the effects of EDCs might be beneficial or harmful to the animal. This project will include an education program to introduce high school students to the impacts of rapidly changing environments on organisms. It will also include outreach to the community by partnering with a local non-profit organization to create 'fish guides' to inform the public of safe areas to catch fish for consumption.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Paragraph:<br/><br/>The influx of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) into aquatic systems constitutes a major anthropogenic disturbance that influences both physiology and behavior. Sometimes, however, behavior does not change in response to EDC exposure. We do not currently understand the costs associated with behavioral maintenance in the face of environmental change. This project uses an emerging vertebrate model, mangrove rivulus fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), to explore how changes in endocrine function promote behavioral maintenance in animals exposed to EDCs and alter the correlation structure among behaviors. Behavioral correlation structures are important indicators of an individual's flexibility and can be used to determine how well they can respond to environmental perturbations, both in the short-term and evolutionarily. The researchers measured behavior and collected hormone samples after exposing individuals of different ages and sexes to a gradient of ecologically relevant concentrations of two major EDCs, ethinyl estradiol and nonylphenol. Behavior analysis indicated that there were no changes in average behaviors following exposure, but the correlation structure among behaviors changed. By assaying hormones, the researchers will determine the extent to which endocrine function impacts singular behaviors and the structure of behavioral correlations following EDC exposure. This approach forwards new perspectives on the interpretation of null results, especially for studies seeking to understand the fitness impacts on individuals persistently exposed to EDCs. It will also provide insights into how physiological systems structure the behavioral phenotype, and perhaps restructure it in response to EDCs in ways that impact individual fitness and opportunities for selection to drive behavioral evolution.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701787","Ryan","Earley","rlearley@bama.ua.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Alabama Tuscaloosa","Tuscaloosa","354870005","2053485152","801 University Blvd.","United States","Alabama","AL","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Elizabeth","Johnson","elee21@crimson.ua.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This decline is correlated with local and regional climate patterns. Understanding how related groups of animals will adapt in response to newly open community niches is challenging. However, we can look to the past to see how animals adapted to the loss of taxa. This project aims to describe how dogs in general (including foxes, dogs, wolves, etc.) responded in their anatomy and behavior during a 5-million-year time span (21 to 16 million years ago) when there were no cats in North America. This time period is known as the Cat-Gap. Working with 3D scanning techniques, including scans at a tiny scale, and using various 3D software, the researchers will analyze the anatomy of the forelimb of fossil dogs before, during, and after the Cat-Gap. Comparisons will be made with modern dogs and cats of known behavior to make interpretations of the potential behavior of the extinct canids. The primary goal is to learn whether certain canids evolved cat-like adaptations during the 5 million years when North America had no cats. This project will provide undergraduate students with opportunities to learn about research through involvement in all aspects of the research. In addition, parts of the research will be developed into a three-day high school level STEM-integrated module with the help of a local ninth grade science teacher.<br/> <br/>The researchers will use 3D imagining techniques (NextEngine 3D scanners, nanoCT imaging) to develop a database of surface images for the humerus, radius, and ulna of extant and extinct felids and canids. These 3D surface images will then be analyzed through 3D landmark morphometrics to compare their morphology to that of fossil canids before, during, and after the early Miocene Cat-Gap (21 to 16 Ma), with an understanding that an individual's morphological adaptations are correlated with its predatory behavior. Preliminary data suggest that canids during the Cat-Gap fall within felids and outside of modern canids in their forelimb morphology. Researchers will examine if this holds true before and after the Cat-Gap, with the hypothesis that the canids were more cat-like in morphology only during the Cat-Gap.

Saltwater intrusion and drought represent serious threats to the stability of coastal wetlands, and may therefore cause substantial changes in their ability to store carbon. Coastal wetlands, including the Florida Everglades, persist under relatively low rates of sea level rise by accumulating soil carbon fast enough for wetland elevation to keep pace. In the Florida coastal Everglades, faster sea level rise, combined with increases in drought and freshwater diversion, have resulted in saltwater moving into coastal freshwater wetlands, changing processes that affect the rates of carbon storage, potentially altering the pace of wetland elevation increases. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to experimentally simulate saltwater intrusion and drought in a brackish Everglades marsh to determine how changes in productivity, soil carbon pools, and water chemistry affect losses in soil elevation and nutrient export to estuaries. Results from this research will provide information for conservation and restoration efforts not only in the Everglades but also for coastal wetlands globally. The project will also give research and lab experience to undergraduates at a major Hispanic-serving institution. Researchers will use this project to inform and engage the public on coastal environmental issues through a variety of outreach activities.<br/><br/>In coastal wetlands, the rates of primary production often exceed decomposition, and can result in significant storage of soil carbon. Preliminary results have suggested a strong interaction between saltwater intrusion and drought on the rates of soil carbon storage in coastal wetlands, but questions remain about the magnitude and mechanisms behind these responses. This research uses a controlled experimental manipulation in which coastal wetland mesocosms are subjected to elevated salinity and simulated drought to disentangle the interactive effects of these two drivers. Changes in carbon storage will be measured through carbon dioxide gas exchange and organic carbon stocks (above and below ground), inputs (root productivity, sediment surface accretion), and outputs (organic carbon decomposition). This research will: (1) Identify changes in carbon and biogeochemical cycling in brackish water coastal peat marshes experiencing elevated salinity and prolonged drought; (2) Test the resilience of coastal marshes to drought through evaluation of a post-drought recovery phase; and (3) Assess the potential for elevated salinity and drought to cause the loss of peat elevation and conversion to open water wetlands.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701763","Jennifer","Richards","richards@fiu.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Florida International University","Miami","331990001","3053482494","11200 SW 8TH ST","United States","Florida","FL","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tiffany","Troxler","troxlert@fiu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Benjamin","Wilson","benwilso@fiu.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Voles, like many mammals, use olfactory cues to choose their mates. This can lead to behavioral isolation between groups of individuals (populations) and ultimately lead to genetic separation (divergence) and speciation. The researchers will document how olfactory cues change across a contact zone, an area where these two closely related vole species meet and potentially interbreed. Chemical profile data and genetic data will be collected from across the contact zone and then statistically compared to determine whether patterns mirror each other; a close correlation will suggest that chemical cues and mating preferences are responsible for genetic divergence. Studying contact zones between recently diverged subspecies can reveal important information about how species form and are maintained as distinct entities.

However, the way in which a species' social system influences developing intelligence is less well understood. While it is known that some animals are aware of the relationships between individuals other than themselves, previous studies have concentrated on short-term knowledge about relationships within a single social group. This narrow focus limits the inferences that can be drawn about how different social systems shape intelligence. This project will test whether acorn woodpeckers can remember the relationships between others for years, an ability that has not been investigated in any non-human species. Acorn woodpeckers are a group-living bird in which relatives maintain a relationship even after years of separation, and kin who no longer live together may act as allies in times of conflict. Thus, if acorn woodpeckers can recognize and remember their neighbors' kin for years, they could benefit by keeping track of competitors' allies. This study aims to identify whether they have this ability. The project will create paid positions for two field assistants and several undergraduates will be mentored and learn transferable skills by assisting in data collection and analysis. The investigators will also continue their scientific outreach and education efforts with youth from under-served communities. By improving scientific understanding of the relationship between sociality and cognition, this project could provide perspective on the evolution of intelligence in general.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of social cognition by testing the hypothesis that acorn woodpeckers can remember the relationships between others for at least two years. The investigators will create playback stimuli that simulate two birds calling in unison, which acorn woodpeckers only do naturally with current or former members of their own group. Woodpeckers will then receive playbacks of the following simulated vocal exchanges: 1) two related birds who formerly lived together two years ago, 2) two related birds who never lived together, and 3) two unrelated birds who never lived together. In all cases, the callers will be unrelated to the subject. If acorn woodpeckers remember the relationships between birds that lived together two years ago, they should recognize Stimulus 1 as being more socially congruent than 2 and 3, and should thus exhibit a longer response latency to Stimulus 1, indicating less violation of expectation. If they recognize the relationship between callers via an acoustic cue of relatedness rather than by memory, they should show a longer response latency to both Stimuli 1 and 2 compared to 3. This work will also provide relevant training and mentoring to undergraduate students. Results will be communicated to the scientific community through publications and the general non-scientific community through outreach efforts.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1701451","Walter","Koenig","wdk4@cornell.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michael","Webster","msw244@cornell.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michael","Pardo","map385@cornell.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The results will provide new insights on the regulation of social interactions among juveniles, which are known to be critically important for development of social competence and socialization in mammals, including rodents and humans. <br/><br/>The research will be integrated with an education plan in which new initiatives will be developed to expose high school and undergraduate students, particularly those from minority and under-represented groups, to hands-on behavioral neuroscience research. The research and education plans will build a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to behavioral neuroscience research and education. Research findings will be disseminated to the public through public lectures, publications, and a web site. The archiving, access, and sharing of data will be according to Boston College policies.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1735934","Alexa","Veenema","aveenema@msu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","7714","MODULATION","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","1096","NEURAL SYSTEMS","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To ensure that future civilian and military systems, ranging from connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to battlefield ad-hoc networks, continue to support services with growing quality, systems must evolve beyond the traditional spectrum licensing model and towards an intelligent spectrum sharing paradigm, in which networks nodes collaborate to efficiently share the spectrum. This radical paradigm shift requires the integration of the latest machine learning advances with the more recent progress in software defined radio, in order to endow wireless devices with the intelligence and agility necessary to realize the vision of efficient unsupervised spectrum sharing. The proposed research aims at addressing this fundamental issue, and will offer ample opportunities to provide interdisciplinary training of students at the intersection of machine learning and communications engineering.<br/><br/>The project envisions a paradigm shift in radio design, which will intertwine agile communications engineering techniques with advanced machine learning algorithms to fuse the traditional physical-layer and link layers into a ""collaboration layer"". Specifically, the approach comprises three key elements: (1) a multi-carrier modulation format at the physical layer that provides the required agility to react to interfering signals; (2) a high-performing modulation recognition software that exploits the latest advances in deep learning and convolutional neural networks to accurately classify the radio frequency signals in the environment; and (3) a decision module exploiting the latest advances in regret minimization online algorithms to achieve high exploration versus exploitation performance in the wireless environment.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1737842","Matthieu","Bloch","matthieu@gatech.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sebastian","Pokutta","sebastian.pokutta@isye.gatech.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The data rate per link has increased exponentially over the last 20 years and is expected to continue to do so into the future if the problem of congested radio frequency spectrum can be solved. Paradoxically, the issue of congested licensed wireless spectrum, in modern networks, is at odds with the sparsity of the entire spectrum usage - as little as 10% use at any given moment. One possibility for next-generation wireless is to employ cognitive intelligent radios that can ""socially"" share the wireless spectrum without disruption of preexisting systems in hopes of increasing the overall usage of available spectrum. These intelligent radios will weave through spectral ""traffic"" as one might envision autonomous vehicles doing someday in the near future; however, unlike vehicles, two of these intelligent radios must meet somewhere in spectrum in order to form a link. This work proposes a universal spectral language to enable rendezvous of cognitive intelligent radios.<br/><br/>The objective of this project will be to create such a language where any wireless device that can sense or ""look"" at spectrum can also communicate via spectrum. This approach is a passive and noninvasive method for spectrum usage optimization with device-to-device communication. The universal language lets heterogeneous devices form networks and mismatched networks share the spectrum without centralized control. This intelligent cognition causes conflict among users and networks which affects efficient and fair spectrum access similar to the human behavior. The behavior of autonomous networks can then mimic this social behavior, leading to a possible solution to sharing spectrum. The algorithms developed on this project will foster a new wireless environment that mimics stable social behavior, using cognitive intelligent radios and universal communication that can lead naturally to intelligent and social solutions to network spectrum sharing.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1738034","Adam","Anderson","aanderson@tntech.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Tennessee Technological University","Cookeville","385050001","9313723374","Dixie Avenue","United States","Tennessee","TN","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Khoury","Non-Technical Summary<br/><br/> Nanostructured materials that are formed by a class of extremely large molecules, advanced plastics called block copolymers, are of growing importance in a variety of emerging technologies. Examples include drug-eluting coatings on stents to prevent rejection; viscosity modifiers in synthetic motor oils to boost fuel economy; vehicles for delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells, such as cancers; membranes to enable lighter weight, non-flammable lithium batteries. In all of these applications, and many more, the nanostructure is created through the ""bottom-up"" process of self-assembly, whereby the molecules are carefully designed to produce the intended structure. However, a fundamental problem of widespread importance is to understand the process of self-assembly itself. In particular, it is essential to know whether the resulting nanostructure is the most favorable, equilibrium one, or whether in fact the system has become structure-trapped in a so-called ""metastable"" state. With this knowledge, it will be possible to tailor a commercial process to produce the most useful nanostructure, reliably and reproducibly, in the shortest possible time. Graduate students trained in this project will acquire a broad suite of skills in chemical synthesis and materials characterization. They will also have extensive opportunities to present technical talks and posters to external audiences, as well as to mentor talented undergraduates. High school students from the greater Twin Cities, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, will be exposed to polymer science through Polymer Day: You Make It, You Break It, a hands-on component of a broader Discover STEM week-long summer camp. A new version, American Indian Materials Week, will be developed, to serve to a drastically underrepresented group in STEM fields. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/> It is the overarching goal of this proposal to elucidate the molecular-level mechanisms by which block copolymer nanostructures achieve equilibrium. By focusing primarily on solution assemblies, i.e., micelles, the molecular factors that dictate the barriers to single chain exchange will be quantified, and then collective motions, such as fusion or fragmentation, will be addressed. The cornerstone of the approach is time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering, which provides an unrivaled, quantitative measure of chain exchange kinetics. Collective motions will require additional tools, such as fluorescence. Structural characterization by small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy will also be important. The use of ionic liquid solvents brings multiple advantages, including the ability to tune thermodynamic interactions precisely, the relative ease of designing both UCST and LCST systems, and the remarkably broad accessible temperature range. The research will aim to answer eight questions: (i) What is the functional dependence of chain exchange barriers on quality. (ii) What is the functional dependence on corona block length? (iii) What is the relationship between chain exchange and the relaxation time of an analogous triblock gel? (iv) How does exchange depend on micelle morphology? (v) What factors control the rates of micelle fragmentation and fusion? (vi) How do micelles equilibrate with respect to aggregation number? (vii) How do mixtures of different micelles equilibrate? (viii) How do these barriers evolve with concentration, from dilute systems to melts?","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1707578","Timothy","Lodge","lodge@umn.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","1773","POLYMERS","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Working with industry and education partners, LLCC will plan, develop and implement this learner-focused CBE program that will increase completion rates while potentially reducing the time and the cost to students. The program will build upon the current knowledge base of each individual student and eliminate unnecessary time and effort on learning objectives already mastered. Because there is limited research for CBE programs developed within existing higher education structures, this project includes a comprehensive evaluation component. Because many institutions in postsecondary education and especially community colleges are looking for innovators who have paved the path in CBE and are seeking advice for best practices and program implementation to better serve their students, LLCC will be positioned to share best practices and data regarding participation and completion to both state and national organizations. Deployed military can use the CBE program to build upon their current knowledge and complete the program entirely off campus as a result of virtual technology. Since LLCC serves a large rural population, this competency-based program will address the barriers faced by rural students wishing to participate in opportunities related to this vital science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. <br/><br/>The project objectives are to provide an alternative delivery model for attaining a cybersecurity certificate by: 1) developing curriculum based on competency driven assessments to deliver a CBE cybersecurity certificate program, 2) developing an effective student admission process for evaluating student skills and behaviors needed to be successful in a competency-based program, 3) developing support services for students including advising, financial aid, and coaching to ensure success and completion in the program, 4) implementing the CBE cybersecurity certificate, and 5) evaluating the process and outcomes of the CBE cybersecurity certificate program. LLCC will contribute course content to the ATE Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CCSIA) at Moraine Community College and the ATE National CyberWatch Center at Prince George's Community College as well as adapt many of their materials for a rural audience. Completion pathways for this program will include a certificate and upon completion of the certificate the student can enter the workforce or continue their educational endeavors. The certificate is a building block to receiving an associate degree, which the student can use to transfer to a four year institution to complete a baccalaureate degree. This program will provide promising opportunities for students (both local and rural), not only at the post-secondary level, but also at the secondary level through dual credit offerings or dual enrollment at the community college.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1700438","Frank","Marsaglia","frank.marsaglia@llcc.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Lincoln Land Community College","Springfield","627949256","2177862384","5250 Shepherd Road","United States","Illinois","IL","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jeff","Mehan","jeff.mehan@llcc.edu","03/20/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although there is evidence that both science centers and natural history museums positively influence public science literacy and engagement, significant differences exist between these two types of institutions. This international workshop on Integration of Science Centers with Natural History Museums for Imparting Informal Education addresses this issue by convening key science center and natural history museum professionals from 9 countries in South and Southeast Asia, as well as the United States, to explore the strengths and limitations of the assets, philosophies and strategies of these institutions. Beyond the benefits science center and natural history museum professionals attending will receive, the effort will significantly contribute to the broader US and international conversation about the future of science centers and natural history museums, as well as other museum-like, science-rich informal education institutions, in these regions and beyond. In particular, supporting personal and cultural relevance has been a major focus of informal science education organizations globally, and the recommendations that emerge from the meeting will significantly contribute to this dialogue and help to make advances in the disciplinary field of informal science education.<br/><br/>This international workshop, hosted in Malaysia and facilitated by researchers from the Institute for Learning Innovation, convenes 40 science center and natural history museum professionals to explore the affordances and constraints of science centers and natural history museum exhibitions, programs, outreach efforts, websites, etc. The conference is designed to examine the opportunities, challenges and barriers to integrating key design principles that blend the best of science centers and natural history museums, while guiding the creation of new forms of 21st century informal science education institutions. Additional goals explore how to make informal science education institutions in general more relevant to 21st century publics, both culturally and personally, as well as foster intra- and international collaborations between science center and natural history museum professionals. Toward these ends, all conference participants will commit to the completion of pre-conference assignments; active preparation and involvement at the meeting; and, assistance with the dissemination of project findings. The major deliverable will be a Whitepaper describing the outcomes of the meeting and the key design principles that leverage the effectiveness and relevance of each of these institutions. The Whitepaper will be produced in both hard copy and electronic form and more broadly disseminated throughout the natural history museum and science center fields in all participating countries. The electronic form will be hosted and available for download through the website of the Institute for Learning Innovation and the Center for Advancing Informal Science Education (CAISE) with links to all participating institutions.

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2017 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2017) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held May 6-11 in Denver, Colorado. The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by approximately 3,400 HCI professionals from around the world. Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI. More information about this year's conference, whose theme is ""Explore, Innovate, Inspire"", is available online at https://chi2017.acm.org/. The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity. Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2017 have already been selected; there are 8 men and 14 women who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds, and there is only one student from any given university.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. The 2017 Consortium will be a 2-day long event on May 6-7. Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. This year's DC represents a nearly 50% increase in the size of the event; to accommodate that many student participants, the group will break into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist. Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants. The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference on May 8-11. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2017 Extended Abstracts. SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.","03/20/2017","03/20/2017","1734526","Jeffrey","Bigham","jbigham@cmu.edu","03/20/2017","Principal Investigator","Carnegie-Mellon University","PITTSBURGH","152133815","4122689527","5000 Forbes Avenue","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project evaluates an innovative and potentially transformative theory of leadership as a compilational multilevel process whereby ""leadership"" is comprised of the patterned interactions of multiple individuals collectively carrying out needed system functions. Three experiments test the core ideas of this leadership model, and develop tools for leadership assessment and program evaluation. These experiments manipulate configurations of leadership and observe the effects of doing so on the emergent structure of the collective, as well as the processes, states, and performance of these collectives. <br/><br/>The scientific study of leadership has long recognized that the behavior of leaders can have extraordinary effects on collectives including teams, units, and organizations. While much of the empirical research on leadership focuses on predicting outcomes that reside at the individual unit of analysis (e.g., job satisfaction, work performance), many of the situations where leaders are potentially most pivotal require complex collective interactions (e.g., coordination, information sharing). Disaster response, vaccine development, and provincial reconstruction are examples of goals that require action by large-scale collectives, and so require leaders to orchestrate the effort within those collectives.

This project proposes Dominoes, a framework that extends the benefits of constraint-based analysis by enabling automatic synthesis of common and emerging use-cases of program analyses, such as finding good abstractions, analyzing incomplete programs, and incorporating user feedback. The intellectual merit of this project is to fundamentally advance demand-driven, compositional, and learning-based analysis techniques. By automatically synthesizing use-cases once and for all, Dominoes amplifies the traditional benefits of constraint-based analysis, liberating analysis designers from having to re-implement those use-cases for their analyses. The project's broader significance and importance lies in enhancing the applicability and usefulness of program analyses by making them more automated, scalable, and flexible. Artifacts embodying these analyses will improve software quality in aspects of reliability, security, performance, and energy efficiency. Dominoes will also improve the productivity of analysis users by allowing them to adapt analyses to their feedback.<br/><br/>Dominoes automatically synthesizes implementations of use-cases for any program analysis expressed in Datalog, a popular declarative logic programming language. Existing constraint-based analysis frameworks predominantly focus on solving hard constraints, whereas Dominoes also accommodates soft constraints that arise naturally in diverse use-cases of program analysis, e.g., to model various tradeoffs, intuitions of analysis users, and missing program specifications. The versatility of Dominoes is demonstrated by applying it to three important use-cases: client-driven analysis, summary-based analysis, and user-guided analysis. Despite their diversity, all three use-cases entail solving instances of the maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem, which consists of a combination of hard (inviolable) constraints and soft (violable) constraints. Solving such mixed constraints is not only computationally hard but also poses the problem of specifying weights or confidences of soft constraints. Dominoes develops MaxSAT optimizations comprising demand-driven, compositional, and learning-based methods that are general and independent of any analysis, use-case, or solver, and aim to scale to instances well beyond the reach of existing MaxSAT solvers.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1737858","Mayur","Naik","mhnaik@cis.upenn.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","191046205","2158987293","Research Services","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7923","SMALL PROJECT","7943","PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, investors hedge their bets by investing in multiple stocks simultaneously or dividing investments between stocks and bonds. This reduces the chance of complete loss due to a stock crash but also reduces potential gains when a stock dramatically rises. Similarly, organisms may have evolved bet hedging strategies that allow them to cope with dynamic environments. To date the evidence supporting the existence of biological bet-hedging strategies stems primarily from theoretical work. To robustly assess evidence for bet hedging in nature, this study takes advantage of a fascinating reproductive strategy, termed offspring polymorphism, in which organisms produce multiple different kinds of offspring simultaneously. This strategy can be observed across many life forms including animals (e.g. frogs) and bacteria but is especially common in plants. Investigators will test the hypothesis that seed-polymorphism plants produce one seed or offspring type that is good at surviving in dry years and one that is good at surviving in wet years. This research will help scientists gain a better understanding of how organisms cope with change. This will increase predictive power about organisms' responses to environmental change and increasing desertification. Outreach to the public will occur, and undergraduate students will be trained as part of this work.<br/> <br/>Through the combination of an innovative field experiment and stochastic population models parameterized with long-term field and experimental data, the researchers will rigorously evaluate seed polymorphism as a bet hedging strategy in Pectocarya heterocarpa, a winter, desert annual species. P. heterocarpa is particularly suitable as it produces three visually distinct and spatially separated seed types which are easy to distinguish and count. These morphs will be sown in a natural field setting under various rain reducing shelters to examine how seeds differ in their germination timing, growth, and fitness under different rainfall regimes. The ecologists will combine this data with multi-decadal temporal and spatial demographic data on P. heterocarpa. They will then parameterize density-dependent and independent models to rigorously evaluate offspring polymorphism as a bet hedging strategy. Specifically, the density-independent model will allow researchers to find optimal seed ratios under different environmental regimes while the density-dependent models allow for an adaptive dynamics approach to find evolutionary stable seed polymorphism strategies.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1702050","D.

Elekonich","Conflict is a pervasive feature of animal societies. Conflicts arise whenever the interests of interacting individuals are not wholly aligned, yet many social interactions require individuals to reach some compromise. Parental care is an interaction that is rife with conflict, because both parents benefit from shifting the burden of care to the other, yet requires cooperation, because both parents benefit from the total amount of care. The outcome of conflict between parents has been modeled using economic game theory models, which assume that individuals act in their best interest but that their optimal behavior depends on how others behave. This project will build on existing empirical and theoretical work to test alternative hypotheses for how parents negotiate care utilizing a tractable study system: the clown anemonefish a.k.a. Nemo. Studying how conflict among caring parents is resolved is critical to understanding why animals, including humans, form such alliances. Undergraduates involved in the project will receive training in aquarium maintenance, assist in ongoing research, and complete independent research projects. This project will also encourage participation of underrepresented groups in science through the researchers' participation in Science Club for Girls and through work with local school groups at the Mahonia Na Dari field station. The results will be broadly disseminated through presentations at international scientific meetings and development of ""data nuggets"" (http://datanuggets.org/) to ensure that results are available in a format that will enhance public understanding.<br/><br/>The existence of biparental care poses a perplexing evolutionary question because parents must coordinate their behavior to raise offspring when there are costs to providing care and inherent conflicts of interest among parents. The objective of this project is to test plausible alternative hypotheses for the factors that govern how parents negotiate the amount of care to provide to their offspring, and create a more general framework for understanding conflict resolution. The researchers will test four alternative hypotheses for how parents negotiate the amount of care to provide to their offspring: H0) Parental effort is fixed; H1) Parental effort is negotiated based on partner effort alone; H2) Parental effort is negotiated with an information asymmetry; H3) Parental effort is negotiated with a power asymmetry; H4) Parental effort is negotiated with a simple form of reciprocity. Experiments will be conducted in a natural population of clown anemonefish (Amphiprion percula) in Papua New Guinea. By supplementing food resources, effort by each parent will be manipulated in a non-invasive and ecologically relevant manner. The anemonefish system allows tests of alternative hypotheses simultaneously, where previous studies have only tested them in isolation. Furthermore, the majority of negotiation studies have been conducted in birds, so utilizing A. percula will test the generality of theoretical predictions. In sum, the proposed research will use a tractable study species together with a rigorous alternative hypothesis testing approach to determine the factors that influence the outcome of negotiations. While incorporating teaching, training and learning, this research will create a more general framework for studying conflict resolution and revise our understanding of negotiations over offspring care.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1701657","Peter","Buston","buston@bu.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","Trustees of Boston University","BOSTON","022151300","6173534365","881 COMMONWEALTH AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tina","Barbasch","tbarbasc@bu.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Professor Dong's group uses a transition metal catalyzed enamine-mediated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) functionalization strategy to transform simple, unactivated olefins. This new reaction offers a number of advantages over the classical ketone-akylation methods, including the substitution of expensive or toxic halide reactants with more environmentally benign and less costly olefins, the use of neutral catalytic conditions rather than stoichiometric amounts of strong bases, and the development of a by-product free process. Professor Dong is actively engaged in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) IMPACT Program for undergraduate mentoring, the Welch Summer Scholar Program for high school student training, and the ""Shadow a Scientist"" program for the early education of middle school and home-schooled students.

Extreme drought events are already taking their toll on trees and other woody plants all over the world, leading to widespread forest mortality. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise on a global scale, the importance of forests increases, as trees can take up carbon dioxide and store it for centuries in the form of wood. However, the death of trees during drought reduces how much can be taken up and increases the amount of carbon dioxide released back into the air when dead trees decompose. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to evaluate which kinds of plants are more susceptible to drought, and the mechanisms that determine plants? vulnerability to extreme drought events. This research has the potential to reveal characteristics that make woody plants more or less tolerant to drought and may increase the ability to predict species? responses to extreme drought events. The results will inform local land managers and policy-makers on which tree species are more tolerant to drought and therefore improve plans for restoration and management of forests in the face of increasing drought severity. <br/><br/>This project will use novel methods to determine the resistance of woody plants to extreme drought using plant anatomical features and physiological measurements. The major cause of tree mortality from drought is embolism accumulation in the water-conducting pipes of plants that obstruct proper water movement from the soil up to the leaves. The researchers will study which anatomical traits make plants more susceptible to embolisms. This work will be conducted in both dry and wet temperate and tropical forests to provide information on how plants growing under different rainfall environments respond to drought. The project will include workshops with public primary school teachers in rural Northwestern Costa Rica, which is an area with a history of extreme droughts that have resulted in widespread forest mortality. These workshops will enhance Costa Rican primary school curriculum through active learning of how plants obtain and use water and the impact of drought on native forests.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1700855","Jennifer","Powers","powers@umn.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Christina","Smith","smit7586@umn.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their arms consist of hundreds of moving parts. As a result, brittle stars can travel rapidly in any direction. They also easily adapt their method of locomotion in response to limb damage and loss. This project will identify the mechanical steps that characterize the evolution of this unique pattern of locomotion. Fossil brittle stars show much greater diversity of arm structure than living brittle stars, making interpretation of their mode of locomotion a challenge. These researchers will characterize the anatomy of fossil brittle stars using 3D imaging and infer their movement capabilities based on biomechanical modeling. This is the first project to employ state-of-the-art 3D imaging and biomechanical modeling techniques to study the mechanics of movement in any non-vertebrate animal. A broader impact of this research is that it opens the door for the systematic investigation of diverse movement strategies across the animal kingdom and their application to mechanical engineering. The unique movement strategy employed by these animals may also help improve robot design. <br/>The first step in modeling brittle star movement is to digitize their internal skeleton using 3D x-ray imaging. A computer program is then used to make a skeletal model and to reconstruct movement at the articulations. Muscle attachment sites are identified in the fossils using high-resolution 3D imaging; the microstructure of the skeleton reveals where muscles insert. A second program is used to incorporate the muscle reconstructions into the skeletal models. The force applied by each arm segment and by the entire arm can be calculated to reveal whether fossil brittle stars could move like their modern relatives, or used a different strategy more similar, for example, to that in living sea stars. These models will allow the mechanical steps leading to the unique form of movement in living brittle stars to be determined, and show how their mode of locomotion evolved.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1701830","Derek","Briggs","derek.briggs@yale.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Elizabeth","Clark","elizabeth.g.clark@yale.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, completing courses and mastering mathematics remain major areas of struggle for students who are pursuing degrees and certification in advanced technological programs at community and technical colleges. Building on findings from a pilot study, the research team composed of university researchers and faculty and institutional researchers at 2-year colleges will investigate the adaptation, implementation, and outcomes of contextualized mathematics, a promising instructional approach designed to improve teaching and learning mathematics by connecting mathematics with academic/occupational content and applications in the workplace. Integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, the mixed methods research study examines faculty professional development, adaptation and implementation of contextualized mathematics in the classroom, and the impact of contextualized mathematics on students' educational and career outcomes in advanced manufacturing, engineering technology, biotechnology, construction technology, and transportation technology. <br/><br/>Using a convergent parallel mixed methods design, this targeted research study is designed to investigate faculty engagement with and professional development around contextualized mathematics and its impact on students. Two critical areas are examined: a) the development of faculty expertise through faculty development and communities of practice, and b) the interim and longer-term impact on student outcomes through the lens of momentum theory, a model of community college student success. Qualitative data collected by in-depth interviews will be analyzed using the constant comparative method to assess data saturation and stability of data categories. Quantitative data include administrative records, surveys, and classroom observations. Surveys will be piloted and validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Classroom observation data will be analyzed using social network analysis. In order to adjust for pre-treatment characteristics of students for establishing balanced comparison groups, the research study applies propensity score matching to address selection bias (enrollment in contextualized mathematics courses). Path analysis will be used to estimate the treatment effect of contextualized mathematics and the potential causal pathways through which contextualized mathematics works (e.g., increased cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational momentum). Convergent analysis will examine the extent to which and the ways in which results from different data sources converge, diverge, and/or connect within and across faculty and student threads of the research.

A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as telephone networks, transportation networks, or the Internet. Various problems arise in the study of such networks, and this research project is concerned with questions of structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific desirable properties, and others do not? A satisfactory answer can have many applications, ranging from better understanding of underlying structure, to the design of efficient algorithms, to practical computations. For instance, one such question answered previously by the investigator settles a question of George Polya from 1913, solves a problem that baffled theoretical computer scientists for quarter of a century, and has applications in economics. <br/><br/>The central theme of this project is graph structure theory and its applications to coloring, flows, and algorithms. More specifically, the investigator will study the structure of graphs pertaining to the graph minor inclusion and will use those results to attack flow and coloring problems, as well as the problem of characterizing ""Pfaffian graphs."" Pfaffian graphs are of interest because they allow efficient computation of perfect matchings, and their rich theory is related to other areas. This research will require the development of new tools in graph structure theory. Improved bounds will have immediate applications to the design of efficient algorithms.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1700157","Robin","Thomas","thomas@math.gatech.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some species have very specialized diets that consist of only one or a few items, while other species appear to eat a broad range of food items. Why some animals have highly specialized diets and how species adapt to new food items remain unanswered questions in the field of biology. This project will use frogs as a study system to understand how and why animals become specialized on different food resources. To do so, it will develop new applications of DNA sequencing to generate data on diet and new methods for analyzing complex datasets. The new methods will be broadly applicable to any system beyond just frogs and the resultant data can provide insight into other major biodiversity questions, such as why there are more species in the tropics compared to temperate areas. This project will develop international partnerships, provide research training to undergraduate students at the University of Michigan, generate large quantities of publicly accessible data for future scientific research, and produce basic natural history data that can be used to inform conservation strategies for endangered frog species.<br/><br/><br/>This research project will integrate methods from phylogenetic community ecology and macroevolution to answer questions about the evolution of diet and how trophic ecology correlates with diversification. It will utilize high-throughput sequencing to analyze stomach contents of frogs from sites across the New World. This work will generate a dataset of prey items identified to species level with information about the relative abundance of each in a frog's diet. The proposed research will use the mitochondrial genomes of the prey items to construct a phylogenetic tree of the prey to pair with a phylogeny of frogs that will be estimated with genomic data. With these two trees, measures of diet breadth and overlap that reflect the phylogenetic variability in the diet and the relative abundance of each prey type will be calculated and used to infer rates of species diversification and trophic evolution. These metrics and estimated rates will then be used to examine phylogenetic conservatism in frog diet, the effect of dietary specialization on speciation, and the correlation between rates of trophic evolution and diversification rates.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1701459","Daniel","Rabosky","drabosky@umich.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","7374","Systematics & Biodiversity Sci",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Joanna","Larson","jglarson@umich.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seahorses provide an ideal model for studying host-microbe interactions for three reasons. The genetic structure of their immune system is simple. Also, their dispersal capability is limited, and their geographic distribution is broad. Previous research on the pot-bellied seahorse across its range in New Zealand and southeastern Australia found striking differences between the pattern of genetic diversity in those parts of the genome related to immune response versus those parts of the genome that are not under selection. This proposal aims to experimentally test field observations of host-microbe associations. It will address a key question in host-microbial co-evolutionary theory: Are host-microbe associations in natural populations a type of local adaptation for immunity? Marine environments provide an essential economic engine for food, transportation, commerce and recreation, but we still have a poor understanding of how human activities impact resident organisms and influence ecosystem health. The results of this research will be incorporated into the NSF-funded Authentic Research Experience in Microbiology program serving students at ten City University of New York campuses, and will inform marine conservation planning and management through the Ministry of Primary Industries, FishServe Commercial Fisheries Services, and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.<br/><br/>Host-microbe interactions are an underappreciated driver of adaptation. This project will evaluate a potential mechanism of local adaptation at the major histocompatibility class II locus (MHII) by testing the fitness consequences of host-microbe associations in the marine species Hippocampus abdominalis (the pot-bellied seahorse). Previous research on wild H. abdominalis across its geographic range detected enhanced levels of MHII variability at the population level relative to neutral loci. Sequencing of the host gut microbiome indicates that the local environment (urban, agricultural, or pristine) has a significant effect on the microbial composition of hosts collected from these sites. Experimental populations of H. abdominalis will be exposed to microbes showing positive, negative, or neutral associations with hosts in natural populations, and effects of MHII genotype on growth, condition, immune response and survival will be measured. The research proposed here represents an exciting opportunity to explicitly test field observations of host-microbe associations and targets a key evolutionary concept, microbe-mediated local adaptation, using an experimental protocol reflecting natural pathways of microbial exposure","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1701788","Tony","Wilson","twilson@brooklyn.cuny.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","CUNY Brooklyn College","Brooklyn","112102889","7189515622","Office of Research & Sponsored P","United States","New York","NY","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jimiane","Ashe","JAshe@brooklyn.cuny.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elekonich","A preference for amino acid-rich floral nectar is ubiquitous among adult moths and butterflies that pollinate flowering plants. Moths pollinating yellow evening primrose (Oenothera flava) flowers can use the intensity of its scent to directly assess the nectar amino acid content. Amino acids improve the reproductive potential of these pollinators and nectar is their only dietary source of amino acids. Despite the demonstrated importance of amino acids to reproduction, it remains unknown how this preference translates into increased fecundity; amino acids consumed by the adult are not directly used to produce additional offspring. This project will combine behavioral theory and physiology to assess how floral preference translates into increased reproduction for both sexes of pollinating moth and to investigate potential underlying physiological mechanisms. The researchers will investigate effects of nectar amino acids on male and female moth reproduction, flight muscle maintenance and function, and trade-offs between immune function and reproduction. This project also provides opportunities for research involvement by undergraduates and exchange students with broader nutritional interests. Furthermore, the investigators will continue activities designed to foster scientific interests in underrepresented groups and share their work with local NY communities.<br/><br/>The fitness benefits of amino acid preferences have been demonstrated in female Lepidoptera, however the mechanisms behind this preference remain unknown and the impact on male fitness has never been assessed. Once completed, this project will provide a systematic assessment of the contributions of nectar amino acids to mating success and reproduction in both sexes of moth and test two physiological theories involving nutritionally mediated reproductive tradeoffs with somatic maintenance and immune response. Using the white-lined sphinx moth (Hyles lineata), the most abundant pollinator of the evening primrose O. flava, this project will experimentally manipulate the nutritional status of adult moths and conduct mating trials to determine how nutritional status affects mate-choice and overall reproductive output in both sexes of moth. To determine if amino acids improve flight ability, which is important for nectar foraging and reproduction, the researchers will also test moth flight ability and muscle strength in combination with histological assessments of overall muscle cell senescence. Finally, to assess the role of amino acids for nutritionally mediated tradeoffs between reproduction and immune function, standard tests of immune function will be used to investigate how nutritional status influences a moth?s ability to resist pathogens while maintaining reproductive output. Undergraduates from the Cornell Biology Scholars program will participate in the research and be mentored by the researchers.

One theory of selection provides a robust explanation for variation in male coloration, or ornamentation, through the process of females choosing increasingly elaborate males over numerous generations. In contrast, the evolution of female ornamental coloration has received comparatively little attention, and is not intuitively explained using current theory. The White-shouldered Fairywren (Malurus alboscapulatus) of New Guinea is an unusual species of bird in which female coloration varies across populations, while male plumage remains constant. Experimental evidence suggests that more ornamented coloration in females is associated with heightened aggression and increased levels of testosterone. However, the connection between behavior and the underlying process that has led to the appearance of female ornamentation in this species remain unclear. This research aims to determine what genes are responsible in male and female fairywrens for producing ornamentation. The research addresses a core goal in evolutionary biology in identifying the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for generating specific appearances, but from a uniquely female-perspective approach. Understanding the processes involved in generating patterns of biodiversity will be communicated to local communities at our study sites in New Guinea and to local school aged children in New Orleans. <br/><br/>A contemporary goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the genomic changes that control phenotypic variation and how genomic variation generates diversity in traits. The investigators will use high throughput sequencing techniques to explore the underlying genetic control of plumage variation in the White-shouldered Fairywren. They have two complementary goals: to use whole genome resequencing to identify regions of the genome that may be under selection and to use RNA sequencing to test for differences in gene expression between distinct female phenotypes. The study will advance the understanding of the evolution of sex-specific coloration by testing hypotheses for how changes in female ornaments may arise on a mechanistic level, which can then be contextualized with data the researchers have gathered on current adaptive function of the trait. The strength of this system is that it presents an opportunity to compare variation in female ornaments, rather than the more commonly observed and better studied variation in male traits. Female ornaments are influenced not only by selective forces acting on the traits, but also by the genetic mechanisms that produce the phenotype. The proposed genetic work will build on prior research in this species to provide a broad understanding of the evolution and function of female ornamentation that integrates field observation, experimental manipulation, and laboratory techniques. In doing so, the research is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the proximate basis for and ultimate consequences of elaborate female coloration.","03/21/2017","03/21/2017","1701781","Jordan","Karubian","jk@tulane.edu","03/21/2017","Principal Investigator","Tulane University","NEW ORLEANS","701185698","5048654000","6823 ST CHARLES AVENUE","United States","Louisiana","LA","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Erik","Enbody","eenbody@tulane.edu","03/21/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Poisson Geometry Conference series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new mathematical tools. The meetings also serve as a unique forum for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field. <br/><br/>Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures.

It will be a major gathering of researchers in these two interacting branches of mathematics. Representation theory is the algebraic study of symmetries in geometry and physics and is at the crossroads of many important areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of shapes that can be described using polynomial equations, and with applying geometric ideas to commutative algebra and number theory. In the past decades, some of the most important results in representation theory have been obtained by applying ideas and methods from algebraic geometry, and conversely many important problems in algebraic geometry have benefited from applying representation theory. The conference will feature one-hour lectures by leading experts in the field, poster presentations, and evening talks by junior mathematicians. The conference will stimulate productive interactions between mathematicians in diverse fields and career stages, including Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The conference will address recent developments in the interconnected areas of representation theory and algebraic geometry, as well as related subjects, including p-adic Hodge theory, arithmetic geometry and non-commutative algebra. In particular, cutting-edge research related to categorification, symplectic resolutions, quantization, D-modules, quiver varities and the Langlands program will be presented. The conference aims not only to disseminate this research but to make it accessible to junior mathematicians.

This workshop aims to introduce aspiring mathematicians in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry and from many institutions to vibrant areas of research, fostering collaboration, forming strong research ties between young researchers, and thus promoting future collaboration and research. The workshop is specifically designed to encourage the development of a diverse group of researchers in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry. It is a week-long intensive workshop, in which all activities occur under one roof. The lectures are delivered by the graduate student participants with the help of three mentors: Roger Casals (MIT), Laura Starkston (Stanford), and Steven Sivek (Bonn), who are emerging expert researchers in the field. This setup enhances communication skills, encourages active involvement or the participants and forging new collaborations.<br/><br/>The topic of the 2017 workshop is symplectic fillings of contact manifolds, a topic with both a rich history and lots of new ideas that are currently being developed. One major aspect of the modern understanding of symplectic fillings is via an ever-growing dichotomy in symplectic and contact geometry: flexibility versus rigidity. Some fillings can be flexible, in which case they are completely determined up to isomorphism by differential-topological data; otherwise, there is a hope that some count of J-holomorphic curves implies that the symplectic geometry is more nuanced than the underlying differential topology. One goal of the workshop is to form bridges between these two different perspectives.

Because manufacturing in the United States has transitioned from traditional models to advanced manufacturing, community college manufacturing programs must evolve to meet these changing industry environments. Working collaboratively with industry partners to determine advanced technical education needs, this project at Patrick Henry Community College (PHCC), a rural two-year college in the Virginia Community College System, is designed to advance knowledge and understanding within community college advanced manufacturing programs. It will provide a model for working innovatively with an entrepreneurial mindset and review, revise, and update advanced technical education curricula by engaging college faculty and industry representatives in a collaborative effort to promote teaching, training, and learning. The participation of the rural and low-income population in the region will be broadened, and the project results will be widely disseminated to enhance scientific, technological, and educational understanding and to serve students from under-represented groups. The project builds on its successful AACC MentorLinks project, which helped to grow the use of college Fab Lab for advanced manufacturing education and training. The primary goal of this project is to develop and implement an Innovate, Design, Engineer, and Accelerate (IDEA) Career Pathway with embedded certifications. It will equip individuals with a career pathway that prepares them with college credit, certifications, and skills recognized by the advanced manufacturing industry and entrepreneurial and design skills proven to assist in building basic skills identified by industry leaders. Evaluation activities will focus on which activities work best for students and industry. <br/><br/>This IDEA program will introduce new curriculum infused with education and training in entrepreneurship and core skills needed in most advanced manufacturing technician positions. It will prepare participants for technician positions and spur innovation and new business development within the advanced manufacturing sector. The IDEA Career Pathway will also provide dual enrolled high school students in career and technical training a pathway from high school to an associate degree program to a baccalaureate degree and towards a career with predicted growth regionally. Students will have the potential to earn up to 24 credits while in high school, along with embedded credentials, all of which credits can be applied to Associate Degree in General Engineering Technology (GET) at the college, which is transferable to four year degree pathways. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the New College Institute, the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research, three regional high schools, and in close collaboration and with ongoing feedback from regional industry leaders. This project will provide professional development to college faculty so that they can successfully implement curriculum for the IDEA program. The project will also strengthen the knowledge base of college students through revised curricula that support critical thinking, scientific reasoning, and innovative design.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1700501","Rhonda","Hodges","rhodges@patrickhenry.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Patrick Henry Community College Foundation","Martinsville","241126693","2766560322","645 Patriot Avenue","United States","Virginia","VA","7412","ADVANCED TECH EDUCATION PROG","1032","ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"David","Dillard","ddillard@patrickhenry.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Colin","Ferguson","cferguson@patrickhenry.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

IRB is an unconscious preference for one racial group over another. It influences behavior, even among people who are not aware of holding any such preference. IRB has been shown to negatively impact interactions between teachers and students, doctors and patients, and police officers and members of the public. Yet, one in five White Americans lacks IRB against African Americans. These individuals are relatively unlikely to contribute to harmful outcomes when they behave spontaneously. In past research, psychologists have identified individual level determinants for IRB (for example, personality and cognitive mechanisms). Scholars of psychology have also identified social factors that influence IRB (for example, age, level of education, and region of esidence). Yet, they have rarely, if at all, explored social factors in depth. Even though psychologists have indicated that IRB is at least partially socially determined, sociologists have generally stopped short of studying this kind of bias. For their part, sociologists have researched the determinants of explicit (that is, conscious and expressed) bias. They have identified a number of causes for such bias, including lack of contact with African Americans, and feelings of threat (either direct or symbolic) vis-à-vis Black populations. While this research offers clear insight into the determinants of explicit bias, it does not identify the determinants of implicit bias as such. Uncovering the social mechanisms that lead some to develop implicit racial bias, while others do not, could produce knowledge that ultimately helps to reduce the levels of this bias across the American public. Such a change would significantly improve the life chances of African Americans throughout the United States.<br/><br/>This research will fill gaps left by the existing psychology literature (which has often left the social determinants of IRB unexplored) and sociology literature (which has focused only on the social determinants of explicit bias). Specifically, the project will explore how contact with diverse others (by race, socioeconomic status, and religion) and experiences of threat by such others influence anti-African American IRB among White Americans. Further bridging the psychology and sociology literatures on racial attitudes, the researchers will advance our currently cursory understanding of how implicit bias relates to contemporary forms of racism theorized that sociologists have theorized (""symbolic,"" ""laissez-faire,"" and ""colorblind"" racism). The study will use an original dataset of Implicit Association Test scores, in depth interviews, and a survey to further current knowledge about the social determinants of implicit racial bias. First, 375 diverse White Americans will take the Race Implicit Association Test (the most common measure of IRB). Then, 30 respondents who hold anti-Black IRB and 30 who lack it will complete in depth interviews with race and gender matched interviewers. Finally, 800 new respondents will respond to the IAT and a survey designed to test hypotheses from the first two phases of research.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1702829","Sandra","Smith","sandra_smith@berkeley.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kristen","Nelson","kristen.n.nelson@berkeley.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This fact is hard to explain for theories that explain inequality with differences in workers' education levels: even similarly-educated workers get paid differently depending on which companies they end up working at. This project instead aims to explain rising inequality by measuring changes in the intensity of competition between rival companies and changes in the balance of power between buyer and supplier companies. By studying the sources of pay differences between workplaces, this project points to a novel set of employer-targeted policies to address rising wage inequality. The research proposed here could help assess how antitrust enforcement, competition policy and product market regulation affect the wage structure. Advocates and policy makers alike have neglected these indirect policy determinants of inequality.<br/><br/>To clarify the sources of rising between-firm inequality, this project brings insights from economic sociology to the analysis of inequality. It builds on and reformulates the structuralist sociology of wages to ask how hierarchical relations between firms can affect wage inequality. Changes in market power are expected to affect inequality by shifting the allocation of good jobs and high wages across different employers. Specifically, the project uses establishment-level and linked employer-employee data to test several contributing sources of changing relations between firms. First, it considers whether shifting product market power has benefited some firms and workers and undermined others. Second, it asks how the reliance of supplier firms on powerful corporate buyers affects suppliers? workers? wages. Finally, it tests whether trends in educational and occupational segregation across workplaces contribute to rising inequality. More broadly, it asks about the consequences of the structured nature of product markets for the distribution of wages: if businesses operate in settings that depart from the assumptions of perfect markets, what are the consequences for their workers? wages?","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1702914","Bruce","Western","western@wjh.harvard.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nathan","Wilmers","wilmers@fas.harvard.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project expands knowledge in two sociological fields: (1) It enhances feminist state theory by examining how women's labors complicate the equation between gender, nation, and state, in a context shaped by a medley of dissonant global forces: Islamization, neoliberalism and securitization. (2) By addressing how culture works in circumstances that create a mismatch between actors and their settings (i.e. in conditions of hysteresis) it contributes to general sociological knowledge of broad interest about how people adapt to and cope with their changing social contexts. Since these women security workers are involved in projects partially funded by US sources, this project will provide valuable new information for US policy makers, enabling them to craft more effective programs to bolster US initiatives promoting health, security, and gender-equity, globally. By bringing marginalized experiences to light, the project will also help enhance mutual understanding between the United States and Muslim cultures, especially in South Asia. <br/><br/>The three cases include policewomen, Lady Health Workers (LHWs), and airline attendants, all three occupations employed by the state to patrol the borders of health, crime, and transportation in Pakistan. These women workers enable the state to extend its reach and its security agenda amongst veiled women citizens, but are stigmatized for breaching their own gendered seclusion to work alongside men. Enforcing and contending with various gender practices, they must manage the tangle of opposing state and global forces. For instance, LHWs must straddle global Islamic discourses surrounding gender as well as global health discourses surrounding risk in motivating women clients to pursue family planning, which is often done in breach of men's wishes. Three kinds of methods are used to analyze how women security workers manage these conflicting logics and contend with their own stigmatization: (1) primary data comprises 120 in-depth interviews with the women, (2) this data is contextualized via observations of the women?s workplaces, their homes, and their interactions with those they serve. (3) Secondary data encompasses textual analysis of training manuals, official websites and news coverage of the women's activities, providing insights into the broader social context within which the women are located. Two research questions will be addressed through this data: (1) How do Pakistani women working stigmatized jobs at the interstices of purdah, globalization, citizenship, and security, balance the tensions that ensue when dissonant logics vie with each other to discipline women's bodies? How do these women's activities shape the public sphere? and (2) How are notions of state, nation, home and family complicated or reworked through these women's activities in the crevices of the globalized clash between state, empire, religious nationalism and gender?","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1702743","Allison","Pugh","apugh@virginia.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Virginia Main Campus","CHARLOTTESVILLE","229044195","4349244270","P.O.

These goals are well aligned with ideas and needs expressed in the Dear Colleague Letter on Data-Driven Discovery Science in Chemistry (D3SC), NSF 17-036, which is reflective of the ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" need, recognized as one of the ""10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investment"". The application of big data and modern data science creates new tools that promise to transform the discovery and design process in chemistry and thus boost our capacity for innovation. In addition to the far-reaching technological implications, this development also promises a significant increase in the return on public and private investments, both in terms of resources and time.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1733626","Theresa","Windus","twindus@iastate.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","SUNY at Buffalo","Amherst","142282567","7166452634","520 Lee Entrance","United States","New York","NY","1978","PROJECTS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"John","McLean","john.a.mclean@vanderbilt.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Johannes","Hachmann","hachmann@buffalo.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lovinger","NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This RUI award supports fundamental research at Murray State University (MSU) in the area of electroactive materials while enhancing the education and training of undergraduate and high school students. The PIs will utilize a relatively novel, cost-effective, rapid-processing approach to prepare a library of polymers containing electrical charges with tunable thermal, mechanical, and conductive properties. Such charge-containing polymers have been implemented in a number of societally important applications, including batteries, fuel cells, power plant flue-gas separations, and pharmaceutical materials. From the polymer-property relationships established as a result of this work, the principal investigators (PIs) will explore the applicability of these new materials in carbon dioxide separation/capture, ion-sensing devices, and in the formation of electroactive fibers. The challenging work proposed here will be performed primarily by a team of undergraduate students from the rural counties of far-western Kentucky and surrounding communities with participation also of local high school students. Student participants will receive a rewarding, cutting-edge research experience that will deepen their understanding of and appreciation for scientific research, thus better preparing them for STEM-related majors, careers and/or pre-professional school. In addition to the hands-on laboratory training and education that these students will receive, the PIs will explore how the techniques/data acquired from this proposal will be used to develop new laboratory experiments to supplement current course offerings in organic, analytical, and polymer chemistry,and will further enhance the new Polymer and Materials Science degree track offered by the Department of Chemistry at MSU. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>This RUI award focuses on the development of a new class of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) materials utilizing thiol-ene/yne click-photopolymerization with a strong focus on how changes in monomer structure and stoichiometry affect the thermal, mechanical, and conductive properties of the resulting PIL networks. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that thiol-ene/yne photopolymerization represents a significant advancement in the formation of solventless, one-part, homogeneous PIL networks due to the rapid and robust nature of the chemistry and the variability that exists with careful modification and selection of monomers. Specifically, fundamental structure-activity relationships will be established by varying the cation, anion, and thiol structures of the starting ionic liquid monomers and analyzing material properties such as glass transition temperature, thermal stability, crosslink density and ionic conductivity. Additionally, FTIR experiments will be conducted in order to explore how structural changes affect polymerization kinetics, as well as dielectric relaxation spectroscopy to elucidate the roles that chain dynamics and ion mobility play on the conductivities of the networks. Once fundamental relationships and kinetics are established, the PIs will explore the potential impact of these thiol-ene/yne PIL materials on a variety of important applications, including carbon dioxide separation/capture, as microchip electrophoresis devices for support of electro-osmotic flow, as membranes in ion-selective electrodes,and as electroactive fibers from electrospinning. The award will support a large number of undergraduate STEM students from the far-western Kentucky region and several local high school students, thereby expanding the educational impact and outreach of the university and department while enhancing the ability of the participating students to pursue a STEM-related career. Synthetic approaches, materials analyses and applications will provide student participants with rewarding research experiences, all while generating results that will be disseminated in internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals and presented at professional meetings.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1708632","Robert","Johnson","robert.johnson@murraystate.edu","03/23/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Murray State University","Murray","420713318","2708093534","328 Wells Hall","United States","Kentucky","KY","1773","POLYMERS","8060","SEES Unsolicited","8249","Sustainable Materials","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","9229","RES IN UNDERGRAD INST-RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kevin","Miller","kmiller38@murraystate.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Langendoen","Understanding language is at the core of intelligent systems, and a required component of several end-user applications such as machine translation, question answering and text summarization. Most computational approaches to extract meaning from text build a semantic representation capturing some of the meaning intuitively understood by humans when reading text. For example, semantic role labelers extract who did what to whom, how, when and where from plain text, and semantic parsers transform text into logic forms. This exploratory EAGER project defines new algorithms for extracting positive interpretations from negated statements by detecting the focus of negation, that is, pinpointing the usually few text chunks within a negation that are intended to be negated.<br/><br/>Negation is an intricate linguistic phenomenon present in all human languages. From a theoretical point of view, it is well known that negation often carries positive meanings ranging from implicatures to entailments. Despite this observation, current computational approaches to understand the effects of negation are limited to scope detection and disregard the numerous positive interpretations immediately understood by humans when reading text with negated elements. This project builds inter-sentential models to detect the foci of negation, a key component to extract positive interpretations from negations. Exploiting the context surrounding a negation is key to improving foci detection, as existing intra-sentential models fail to take into account key related events that signal the correct foci out of the many potential foci for a given negation. Being able to extract positive interpretations from negation will benefit the overall extraction of meaning from text, since once positive interpretations associated with negative expressions have been identified, they can be integrated with the interpretations obtained for the text as a whole.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1734730","Eduardo","Blanco","eduardo.blanco@unt.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator","University of North Texas","DENTON","762035017","9405653940","1155 Union Circle #305250","United States","Texas","TX","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7495","ROBUST INTELLIGENCE","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data science has experienced rapid recent development, largely in response to the challenges associated with massive data sets. The enhanced ability to collect and store data requires a fundamental change in approaches to data analysis. Today's big data challenge presents a unique opportunity to discover new scalable approaches and to expand current theoretical and computational algorithms. The conference features keynote lectures by Andrea Bertozzi and Aad van der Vaart. Additionally, a dynamic group of U.S. and international researchers at different career stages will give invited plenary talks and poster presentations. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participation costs for approximately forty researchers, giving priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members. <br/><br/>The 2017 Barrett Lectures will be the 47th installment of a lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of the Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-running mathematical lecture series in the country and are delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 47th Lectures is the application of several mathematical methods in topics of data analysis and the growing penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of prominent researchers will expose several research avenues for integrating aspects of our respective (but seemingly disparate) big data perspectives. These connections will ultimately deepen our understanding of the emerging methodologies, which are vital for solving the scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century. Young researchers, especially, will benefit from exposure to the wide array of approaches presented at the meeting.

For example, one major focus of the project is a model from statistical physics that replicates power-law behavior seen in the distributions of the frequencies of earthquakes, avalanches, etc. This model exhibits behavior of striking complexity resulting from simple rules, and is a natural de-randomization of related stochastic models from physics. Another aim of this project involves new kinds of probabilistic analyses of algorithms. These may, for example, give guidance on which algorithms may be efficient for ""typical"" inputs, and which will not. Finally, this project supports the education and mentorship of undergraduates through opportunities for engagement in research. <br/><br/>This proposal concerns two principal research directions. The first concerns a pseudorandom diffusion process -- the Abelian sandpile -- which is at the same time both extremely simple in its mechanics, and extremely complex in its behavior. The rich fractals produced by the model had frustrated decades of inquiry. This project aims to extend the mathematical framework recently developed by the principal investigator and collaborators; for example, to understand the effect the choice of underlying lattice has on the behavior of the sandpile. The second area concerns new kinds of probabilistic analyses of point configurations and networks. For example, the question of the length of the shortest cycle through a collection of points in the plane is the Traveling Salesman Problem for Euclidean space, a problem of both classical theoretical interest and immediate practical utility (in transport problems, drilling problems, etc.). A major educational goal of the project is the mentorship of undergraduate research; the investigator has experience in designing courses and research seminars that have been effective for this goal.","03/23/2017","03/23/2017","1700365","Wesley","Pegden","wes@math.cmu.edu","03/23/2017","Principal Investigator","Carnegie-Mellon University","PITTSBURGH","152133815","4122689527","5000 Forbes Avenue","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7970","Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project is line with the requirements for breakthrough battery technologies articulated by the US Department of Energy ""EV Everywhere Grand Challenge"" as well as the specific goals in the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium's ""EV 2020"", 25% lower cost, 2x higher performance. Although Li-ion technology is currently used in relatively low volume production plug-in hybrid and niche high performance vehicles, the technological goals required to enable truly mass adoption of EV are likely beyond the capabilities of Li-ion. Several advanced battery technologies have been under development but there has been no successful example of commercialization directly into the large mobility space. As such, identification of a viable stepping stone market strategy is paramount for commercialization of a new battery technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential for a Ceramic Solid-state Battery. This project furthers develops a scalable, low-cost, bulk-scale solid-state batteries using superionic conducting oxides. The work builds from research on a superionic conducting oxide membrane technology exhibiting unique breakthrough materials properties. Current progress demonstrates that bulk-scale ceramics processing of these materials is feasible. The solid-state construction and materials chemistry allows for compatibility with Li metal resulting in 2x energy density compared to Li-ion. A manufacturing scheme is being developed which utilizes conventional manufacturing tools and eliminates the need for dry room processing with a path forward to cost structures lower than competing Li-ion technologies. While these features can broadly add value in several industrial sectors, successful commercialization of a battery technology requires accurate identification of a viable beachhead market so a go-to market strategy can be developed.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1740497","Travis","Thompson","tthom@umich.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lymphedema is a progressive and chronic swelling with many distressful symptoms after cancer treatment. Each year, 1.38 million women worldwide and more than 230,000 women in the US are diagnosed with breast cancer. At least 20-40% of breast cancer survivors have developed lymphedema and the rest of them are at lifelong risk for lymphedema. This project further develops a lymphatic therapy effective in reducing the risk of lymphedema and relieving lymphedema symptoms for breast cancer survivors. The approach may potentially be applied more broadly to individuals with chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease and hypertension with similar abnormal fluid accumulation symptoms.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a lymphatic therapy. The core technology consists of a physical therapy system that can automatically and accurately track a patient's movement and evaluate it against the desired movement. The system provides instant feedback on whether a patient is performing an exercise correctly and how should the patient make adjustments in their movement. Furthermore, the system will be designed to motivate the patient to perform the therapy correctly and regularly. The system will leverage the novel computer vision and machine learning algorithms being developed in an on-going research project in order to overcome the sensor constraints in detecting joint positions and the significant variability of the normal range of the desired movement, which are the major technical obstacles faced by current sensor-based physical therapy systems.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1740385","Yao","Wang","yw523@nyu.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","New York University","NEW YORK","100121019","2129982121","70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S","United States","New York","NY","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mei","Fu","mf67@nyu.edu","03/24/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, as the current technology approaches limits set by the laws of physics, gains in performance and power efficiency are no longer realizable through conventional techniques. It is critical that a diverse group of students be trained in unconventional approaches, so that they can take new ideas to practice as part of the semiconductor industry and continue the phenomenal growth of the past decades known as the Moore's law. Asynchronous circuits and systems design, to be pursued in this project, is one such unconventional approach being studied as a way to improve computational efficiency. The project also collaborates with the Binational Science Foundation (BSF) of Israel to leverage complementary research expertise.<br/><br/>Automated timing validation is a critical component in physical realization of a digital circuit. Timing validation ensures that the physical implementation of the circuit is consistent with the intent of the designer, in spite of the uncertainties and constraints introduced by the manufacturing process. Two components are necessary for timing validation: a mathematical foundation, and software that realizes the validation process by implementing the mathematics. The goal of this effort is to develop these two components for the timing validation of asynchronous circuits. The project brings expertise from two different disciplines to bear on this effort: (i) asynchronous circuit design and implementation, and (ii) the theory of asynchronous distributed systems. The project adapts the concept of potential causality from the distributed systems literature to the context of asynchronous circuits.

As electronic devices continue to shrink in size they are faced with compounded issues of power consumption, heat generation and dissipation. As the devices become more sophisticated and the users of such devices demand more utility and connectivity, a need for providing more functionality with less power consumption, decreased heat management, and extended battery life is in critical demand. The Near-Threshold-Voltage (NTV) modular regulator is adaptable to commercially available integrated circuits and provides an innovative solution to these issues. The commercial impact of this NTV modular regulator technology could be realized by saving power consumption and by cutting expenses in development costs to qualify for new generation of low-power electronics. Similar savings and an even broader impact may be envisioned when the modular designing tool is used for a variety of applications using legacy CMOS circuitry and enabling seamless updates to newer technology without substantial development costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a Near-Threshold-Voltage (NTV) modular regulator that is practical for semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) products. The regulator reduces power consumption of many commercially available ICs by running at slightly higher than NTV regions auto-set by the design. It lowers the IC internal operating voltages and enables them to run smoothly at above 95% regulation while minimizing the noise effects. With this module, the ICs will not require external voltage regulators, which further minimizes the unused space on circuit boards. The module is adaptable to ICs without making expensive and drastic changes to their original VLSI designs, especially avoiding the costly technology process transfers for manufacturers. Many devices utilizing System-On-a-Chip (SoC) architectures will realize the advantages of using this module as part of the layout without changing the core circuitry. As the module is process adjustable by design, the SoC does not need to rely on software solutions to regulate power consumption. With the NTV module, existing ICs can easily adapt to emerging CMOS technologies thus sustaining or reviving their period of performance.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1740389","Ruyan","Guo","ruyan.guo@utsa.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at San Antonio","San Antonio","782491644","2104584340","One UTSA Circle","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, she will focus on occurrences of inadvertent neglect of pertinent available knowledge in design decision-making that unintentionally caused failures, in some cases soon after the structures were placed into service. The PI has nine case studies planned. This grant will support research for the first of the nine planned studies, which concerns the use of galvanized high-strength steel. The PI has done preliminary historical analysis and interviews to substantiate pursuing this case in much greater depth. The results from this project will provide the foundation for the PI's larger effort, serve to introduce the Science, Technology, and Society (STS) community to an overlooked engineering profession, and bring to light decades of recurring failures, many not well publicized that, that in some respects have broader, deeper adverse effects on society than one-time (singular) catastrophic events. <br/><br/>This project is both innovative and potentially transformative. It will develop a hybrid conceptual framework that combines Actor Network Theory (an STS approach to socio-technical systems) with a Knowledge Management Systems approach that deals with knowledge facilitators (creators, carriers, conveyors, and users), impeders, and feedback loops within and among organizations. The PI will argue that neither of the two frameworks mentioned is adequate for capturing pertinent elements of her case study, which is best understood in terms of a framework that combines the most relevant features of both frameworks. In addition, the PI will prepare/present a peer-reviewed paper for an STS journal, a peer-reviewed paper for an engineering studies journal, a technical article for a professional structural engineering magazine, and a conference paper at the 2017 meeting of the Society for Social Studies of Science. The results of this project will be of interest to members of the public as well as structural engineers, architects, and historians of technology.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1724829","Julie Mark","Cohen",NA,"03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Cohen Julie M","Latham","121104727",NA,NA,"United States","New York","NY","7603","SCIENCE, TECH & SOCIETY","7916","EAGER","1353","Hist & Philosophy of SET","7567","SOC STUDIES OF SCI, ENG & TECH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unlike standard ""asynchronous"" logic this approach inherently uses physical time as part of its representation of information. The systems and techniques to be developed in course of this research can benefit a number of important applications, including sensor networks and biomedical instrumentation in health care. The body of knowledge to be created would potentially find applications in other areas as well, including control systems and robotics. The work has a significant educational component, in that it involves synergistic development, combining different domains of knowledge and thus training the graduate and undergraduate students involved in interdisciplinary work, leading to new, creative solutions. <br/><br/>Appealing technical properties of this approach include the absence of aliasing, better spectral properties of error, and faster response to changing inputs, compared to classical techniques. The approach is suitable for certain applications that demand very low power dissipation, notably those involving portability or difficult-to-access locations. While prior work concentrated on demonstrating the feasibility of continuous-time digital signal processors, this new effort concentrates on developing next-generation systems and achieving very high performance, necessitating new principles and techniques. The work seeks to advance the performance of continuous-time digital signal processors by reducing the effective sampling rate and improving output reconstruction, by using special coding techniques for relaxing granularity requirements in the signal processing units, by processing directly non-uniformly quantized signals, and by employing algorithmic techniques; it also expands continuous-time digital techniques to general scientific computation. The proposed effort brings together two groups with complementary expertise. The Columbia University group specializes in mixed-signal circuits and has demonstrated the first continuous-time digital signal processors; the Cornell University group works in asynchronous digital electronics, including event-driven processors and asynchronous dataflow FPGAs.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1734577","Rajit","Manohar","rajit.manohar@yale.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7923","SMALL PROJECT","7945","DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This two-day workshop to be held in Denver, CO August 15-16, 2017 will bring together approximately 30 interdisciplinary and international experts from fields that are using microbiome analyses (human body, built environments) and drinking water research on microbial diversity using meta-omics techniques. Experts will discuss current drinking water microbiome monitoring techniques in water treatment, the state-of-art of meta-omics techniques, and the impact of the drinking water microbiome on public health in plenary sessions, breakout groups, and facilitated panel discussions.<br/><br/>Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, bioinformatics, and big-data technology have allowed scientists and researchers to effectively use these meta-omics (e.g., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics) tools to study microbiomes in various microbial ecosystems. National, multi-agency programs have been developed to study and elucidate the microbiomes of the human body and built environments. The NIH-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop meta-omics protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput meta-omics data. Similarly, the National Academies? Board on Life Sciences has announced a large-scale project to assess the state of knowledge on microbiomes of the built environment and the implications for human health, sustainability, security, and the design, construction, and operation of physical infrastructural systems and other elements of built environments. Nevertheless, the use of advanced meta-omics techniques to study the drinking water microbiome is at its infant stage. It remains an important question whether a deep understanding of drinking water microbiomes by meta-omic tools can be obtained in a systematic and cost-effective way so that the knowledge can be used by water utilities to better manage the water quality, shape the drinking water microbiome, and ultimately protect public health. Current conventional and advanced treatment processes are producing high-quality and safe drinking water. However, emerging research is uncovering that drinking water distribution systems can harbor microorganisms in biofilms and suspensions. Healthy tap water is teeming with microbial life, typically 1,000-50,000 total microbial cells per mL, potentially reaching over a million. The quality of this water begins to deteriorate in the current premise plumbing infrastructure when water is stored for days to months and beyond the time that residual disinfectants and anti-corrosive agents (e.g., phosphates to protect against lead leaching) are effective. This deterioration can lead to microbial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing which can cause undesirable water quality changes and violations of public health regulations. Specifically, biofilms can act as natural harbors for some opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium avium and Legionella pneumophila) that affect immune compromised populations, allow invasive pathogens to attach when intrusion events occur, and remain as a component of waterborne disease risk that is hard to predict. Already, there has been a 3.5 fold increase in Legionnaire?s disease outbreaks, caused by Legionella pneumophila, between 2000 and 2011. The problem is further compounded by the presence of pathogens that are resistant to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, which would in turn increase morbidity and mortality rates among infected individuals. Antibiotic resistance genes present in the water can also be horizontally acquired from one pathogen to another, hence further escalating the potential risks. There is an urgent need to improve and disseminate our understanding of the microorganisms in our drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing (or drinking water microbiome) to protect the public from increasing risk to chemical and pathogen exposure. To improve and disseminate our understanding of the microorganisms in our drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing (or drinking water microbiome), this workshop aims to: 1) provide an overview of current drinking water treatment processes and methods used in studying drinking water microbiome, and identify current challenges and gaps in applying meta-omics tools to effectively understand the drinking water microbiome; 2) provide an overview of the most advanced meta-omics tools used in studying microbiomes, and identify the research needs for bridging the use of meta-omics techniques to the analysis of drinking water microbiome; and, 3) provide an overview of known microbiomes that are of public health concern in distribution systems and premise plumbing, and to identify the knowledge gaps on how to effectively shape drinking water microbiome using innovative engineering approaches, and better manage healthier drinking water networks. Through this, analytical procedures in meta-omics techniques can be standardized, and this effort will allow researchers, scientists and utility engineers to effectively compare their findings among different studies, select effective methods among all available meta-omics techniques, identify novel key biomarkers for water quality monitoring, and derive critical knowhow. At the same time, it allows educational institutions to work closely with water utilities to develop effective education programs and produce the next-generation researchers and engineers who have real-scale research and working experiences. These advances will enable the major breakthroughs needed to better understand the drinking water microbiomes within the next 5-10 years to help protect the public from increasing risk to pathogen exposure.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1701641","Wen-Tso","Liu","wtliu@illinois.edu","03/24/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Water Research Foundation","Denver","802353098","3033476102","6666 W.

In this project, a hierarchical testing and implementation approach is used to generate and evaluate innovative spectral access techniques. To do so, the team is equipped with a broad range of backgrounds from FPGA development and machine learning to 3GPP standardization and extensive in-field experimentation. There are four particular areas of focus for the team: (i) network management including control structure and topology discovery, (ii) network discovery including modulation recognition and network recognition, (iii) spectrum access including channel selection, access mechanism design, and decision metrics, and (iv) link design including waveform selection, channel coding, and channel estimation. A central concept hinges on the role of the collaboration channel, on which the role of periodic and uniform levels of information exchange is studied related to channel availability across networks from no, partial, and full knowledge scenarios. Using machine learning and on-the-fly training with observations of network decisions and resulting performance, the focus then shifts to designing for robustness with respect to greater levels of latency and heterogeneity that result from non-standard protocols and algorithms across a diverse set of radios.<br/><br/>The scope of the project includes the following three aspects. First, an agile research approach is employed using a hierarchy of implementation complexity to evaluate multiple design ideas, progressing through simulation tools, software-defined platforms, and FPGA hardware implementations and weighting the time spent according to the measured success of each design idea. Second, the role of the collaboration channel is extensively studied and evaluated in terms of spectral efficiency and coordination across teams by attempting to predict spectral availability of all users across the relevant spectrum in a homogeneous network context and select the channel availability update rate and size to attempt to maximize performance of these two metrics. Third, these findings develop the basis for extension to networks with high levels of latency and heterogeneity across the network stack where flexibility of information exchange across the collaboration channel is far more critical, forcing on-the-fly training that are built into the nodes to observe and reinforce machine-based decision making.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1737732","Joseph","Camp","camp@lyle.smu.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Southern Methodist University","Dallas","752750302","2147682030","6425 BOAZ","United States","Texas","TX","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current mechanisms for control are largely legislative, granting organizations and individuals the right to exclude others. Exclusive use of frequency ranges over time and space can be highly inefficient - denying non-interfering, would-be users access despite under-utilization by rights holders. Spectrum collaboration is advanced as an alternative control mechanism in which intelligence on the part of transceiver equipment is used to simultaneously govern access and maximize utilization. Such intelligence is manifested in the form of sophisticated algorithms and supporting flexible radio and computing hardware. This proposal takes a systems approach to spectrum collaboration. The PIs propose new approaches to understand and classify activities within a range of frequencies and to study and evolve channel access protocols that are both proactive (getting data through) and polite (assisting others in the mission of getting their data through). More broadly, the investigators seek to create novel protocols and tools to facilitate spectrum sharing.<br/><br/>The proposed research is built on three pillars: (a) improved spectrum sharing through PHY-layer optimization techniques such as beamforming and interference cancellation, (b) mechanisms to learn the RF environment and spectrum usage patterns using reinforcement learning and signal classification, and (c) defining a model for spectrum sharing, called channel-as-society (CAS). The investigators contend that advances in these three domains have direct applicability to the practice of spectrum collaboration and the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) in particular. The investigators' ongoing joint work on Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LP-WAN) serves as a testbed for some of the concepts relevant to SC2, both informing and being informed by the proposed research.

These Amendments to the US Constitution were passed in the period 1865 - 1870. The title of this project reflects the general theme of the event and the projected activities for the conference. It has two major goals. The focused goal of this event is to bring together an interdisciplinary group of undergraduates, graduate students, and senior scholars in STEM disciplines to explore, in a research context, the long evolution of economic and race inequality in the US, despite these three Amendments, over the course of the century and a half after their passage into law. A second longer term goal is to continue to develop laddered research settings in higher education that combine the efforts of undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty in a conscious effort to provide new research findings and expose undergraduates to rich research in the social sciences. <br/><br/>The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution officially abolished and continues to prohibit slavery. The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution declared that all persons born or naturalized in the United States are American citizens, including African Americans. The 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits each government in the United States from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The value in a focused study these Amendments is that their full enactment did not become fully operational in the legal sense until the mid-1960s. The early promise of these amendments was reduced by state laws and federal court decisions over the course of the 19th century. Their promise was legally re-affirmed in the 1950s and 1960s, but the real social and economic implications took another half century to fully define.","03/24/2017","03/24/2017","1705963","William","Darity","wd2@duke.edu","03/24/2017","Principal Investigator","Duke University","Durham","277054010","9196843030","2200 W.

The low utilization of these bands, coupled with exponentially increasing demand, has led to the problem of spectrum scarcity for wireless access. Work on this award is expected to yield paradigm-shifting innovations that will achieve significantly higher spectrum utilization by facilitating dynamic sharing of spectrum among different wireless networks and users. The research will inform public policy on spectrum allocation, lead to better quality of service and faster Internet access for wireless users, and enable new multimedia applications. Students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, will acquire hands-on experience with cutting edge wireless technologies.<br/><br/>The work on this award has two unique research directions that are expected to have significant impact. First, a systems and optimal control approach to collaborative spectrum sharing will be developed. This approach relies on cooperative decision making among all components of the solution (e.g., spectrum sensing, communication, reasoning, and control); all decisions made within the system are mindful of the overall system objective. In order to achieve broadly cooperative decision making, new ideas from event-triggered and self-triggered control will be used. Rather than periodically updating control signals, these control frameworks introduce decision making when signals should be updated and when new information should be obtained, respectively. Second, the use of trust establishment schemes will be investigated, with the explicit goal of incentivizing collaboration among networks. As part of this research task, a trust, or reputation, metric will developed, along with tunable algorithms that maximize the balanced score between internal network performance and global network performance. The proposed research on spectrally efficient communications and radio environment understanding will also be critically important for enabling collaboration in the spectrum domain.","03/27/2017","03/27/2017","1737989","Cameron","Nowzari","cnowzari@gmu.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","George Mason University","FAIRFAX","220304422","7039932295","4400 UNIVERSITY DR","United States","Virginia","VA","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brian","Mark","bmark@gmu.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jill","Nelson","jnelson@gmu.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Bernd-Peter","Paris","pparis@gmu.edu","03/27/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Exponentially growing demand by phones, computers, and the internet of things drives a need for significantly improved dynamic spectrum sharing and allocation. Spectrum allocation is slowly moving towards automated management, with improved efficiency and new wireless services enabled at each step. New spectrum systems still require controlled management of the spectrum. By comparison, this project investigates ways to completely automate the management of spectrum, leaving it to individual devices to learn how to collaboratively share spectrum.<br/><br/>The project team is an interdisciplinary research group that brings together the disciplines of ""Big Data"", machine learning (ML), telecommunications, and signal processing. Efficient opportunistic radio spectrum allocation requires intelligent dynamic agents that can make real-time decisions at the time scale of tens of milliseconds, and can only be achieved using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. A key ingredient for making informed spectrum allocation decisions is the accurate identification of radio signals such as radio and TV broadcasting, local and wide area data networks, cell phones, analog and digital voice, radar, etc., which have been contaminated by noise, fading effects, timing errors, and transmission channel distortion. The project focus is on the development and implementation of ML strategies for classification, strategies for wireless network configuration and multi-network collaboration. Building upon successful strategies that have been used for image and voice recognition, this project adapts deep learning (DL) algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and reinforcement learning networks for the classification of communication signals.","03/27/2017","03/27/2017","1738097","Lijun","Chen","lijun.chen@colorado.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Colorado at Boulder","Boulder","803031058","3034926221","3100 Marine Street, Room 481","United States","Colorado","CO","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sangtae","Ha","sangtae.ha@colorado.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Peter","Mathys","mathys@boulder.co.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Youjian","Liu","youjian.liu@colorado.edu","03/27/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dirk","Grunwald","dirk.grunwald@colorado.edu","03/27/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One area of particular interest is the development of specialized bacteria that can consume industrial waste products and convert these compounds into molecules that can be used to produce fuels, plastic monomers and other commercially important chemicals. This project focuses on re-purposing a naturally occurring subcellular factory found in common bacteria into a specialized compartment for the conversion of an industrial byproduct (formate) into a versatile molecule (pyruvate) that can be used by bacteria as a precursor to many desirable compounds. The project exemplifies a ""build it to understand it"" approach, by emphasizing bioengineering based on structural information. Moreover, it will provide a crucial test of our understanding of bacterial microcompartment assembly and whether enhancement of enzyme function can be achieved by encapsulation in a microcompartment. The project will provide interdisciplinary training to early career scientists in computational, structural, molecular, and synthetic biology. <br/><br/>The project involves computational protein and microcompartment design via structure-based modeling to engineer a synthetic metabolic pathway, the PFK-PKT pathway. The project is grounded in a theoretical pathway that can be realized with pyruvate formate lyase, an oxygen-sensitive enzyme that restricts the synthetic pathway to anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions. To solve this limitation, an organelle to encapsulate pyruvate formate lyase and the requisite supporting enzymes will be built and the permeability of the repurposed bacterial microcompartment shell engineered. Several complementary strategies will be pursued, including a top-down approach to repurpose naturally occurring glycyl radical enzyme microcompartments and a bottom-up approach to construct the requisite protein core for encapsulation in the microcompartment shell. The Broader Impacts of the project include the training of undergraduates and Postdoctoral Fellow who will take part in an international collaboration between the groups of an established synthetic biologist and a theoretician.

The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions. The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history. The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panthéon Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation.","03/27/2017","03/31/2017","1732344","Dennis","O'Rourke","orourke@ku.edu","03/27/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kansas Center for Research Inc","LAWRENCE","660457568","7858643441","2385 IRVING HILL RD","United States","Kansas","KS","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES","1079","ARCTIC RESEARCH","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","5221","ARCTIC SOCIAL SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is arguably the most important process on the planet as the source, directly or indirectly, of all our food, most of our fuel and fibers, and the oxygen that we breathe. Global dietary trends and population growth mean that by 2050 the world will require 70% more food from crops, and ultimately from photosynthesis, than it is producing today. To avoid destroying more forest and other prime habitat while not stressing water and fertilizer resources, we need to produce this extra 70% on land currently in use for food production, such as the US Midwest. However, the techniques that gave us large yield increases during the Green Revolution are now reaching their biological limits, and new innovations are needed. Photosynthesis in today's crops achieves less than 20% of its theoretical efficiency in terms of use of solar energy, water, and nitrogen fertilizer, and there has been little improvement in crops over the last 100 years. Scientific understanding of the process has developed rapidly. In 2016, it became possible for the first time to move this understanding from the computer and laboratory to demonstrate productivity increases on farm fields. This meeting will bring together experts and young scientists inspired by these developments to discuss how these fundamental science advances are being and will be applied in crop production to the benefit of global food supply, the environment, and rural economies.<br/><br/>Advancing and applying our understanding of CO2 assimilation in plants and algae has never been more important to society than it is today.

For example, new non-trivial trends, patterns, and associations among entities of interest, such as associations between genes, proteins and diseases, and the connections between different places or the commonalities of people, are such forms of underlying knowledge. The goal of this research is to explore automated solutions for sifting through these extensive document collections to detect interesting links and hidden information that connect facts, propositions or hypotheses. In addition, a more comprehensive view of discovered knowledge will be provided by generating an in-depth and concise cross-document summary explaining the underlying meaning of each connection, along with relevant links and explanations acquired from the Wikipedia knowledge base, which serves as the primary means of complementing or enhancing existing information in text collections. The project will impact many areas, such as homeland security, aviation safety, biomedical and healthcare applications. The techniques will have the potential to expose new information available in large document collections and to provide a multi-view perspective of discovered hypotheses by integrating domain knowledge and relevant information acquired from Wikipedia. Research-based education and training opportunities will be offered by this project to prepare students at all levels in information analysis and discovery. Specific attention will also be paid to promoting the participation of underrepresented groups in the research efforts.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the exploration of a novel textual knowledge representation, integration, and mining framework that will cover the following areas: (i) automatic construction of graphical frameworks for entity relationship discovery, a new representation conducive to fine-grained information search and discovery; (ii) effective integration of information from multiple sources, including knowledge contained in representative data collections, domain-specific knowledge (e.g., domain ontologies), and world knowledge (e.g., lexical resources such as WordNet and large-scale knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia); (iii) new discovery algorithms and tools that identify hidden connections among entities; (iv) enhancement of domain modeling through enabling automatic ontology-driven scenario detection and topic-level modeling; and (v) interactive visualization tools for the graphical framework and discovered hypotheses. This research proposes that next-generation search tools require the capability of integrating information from multiple interrelated units and combining various evidence sources, which will make fundamental advances in the current state of the art for information search and discovery. A combination of techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Semantic Web will be explored to attack critical information discovery problems.

The uniform and tunable pore size, together with the control over the charge and functionality of the framework combine to enable new and more efficient applications in anion exchange, separation, detection, and conduction. Nature abhors cationic frameworks and comes out with various neutralization ways to prevent their formation. This project combats this nature's tendency using novel concepts and strategies to counter such natural tendency proactively and preemptively. Being at an undergraduate institution with a large population of students including those from underrepresented groups, the PI strives to utilize the NSF support to promote teaching and training of students by establishing a highly stimulating and important research project and by developing the state-of-the-art synthetic and instrumental capability to broaden learning opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL Abstract: <br/>The project seeks to develop new synthetic concepts and methods to create porous materials with the positively charged framework integrating uniform and tunable pore size with mobile anions for applications such as anion exchange, sequestration, separation, sensing, as well as fast anion conduction. It deals with fundamental issues in materials design such as the control of ratio between negative and neutral functional groups and the ratio between metal ions in mix-valence or heterometallic systems. Such issues are fundamental to the control of the framework charge property and their applications. The core strategy involves designing cluster-type structural building blocks with propensity for being cationic and simultaneously inventing advanced methods to proactively prevent possible neutralization of such units. Various methods are used to tune the pore size and properties to enhance process selectivity based on size, shape, and charge of molecules and ions. The project integrates a variety of student-training activities ranging from chemical synthesis, crystal growth, to crystal structure analysis and property characterizations with the goal to broaden the participation of undergraduate and graduate students in chemical research and to promote a diverse student population in materials sciences.","03/28/2017","03/28/2017","1708850","Xianhui","Bu","xbu@csulb.edu","03/28/2017","Principal Investigator","California State University-Long Beach Foundation","Long Beach","908154670","5629858051","6300 State Univ.

The approach, if successful, can provide a basis for compact devices that are portable for measuring harmful molecules. <br/><br/>There is a scarcity of sensors for detection of small biological molecules. The current approach - enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) - generally cannot be used for sensing small biomolecules due to limited binding sites on the antigen. An alternative approach is needed. Antibodies that have antigens bound to them are recognized in mammalian systems by C1q protein. It is generally accepted that all antibodies undergo a conformational change when they bind to an antigen. The change is recognized by the protein, C1q, which attaches to the conserved, Fc, region of the antibody. In the proposed work, C1q recognition event will be used to examine feasibility of detecting small bioanalytes in aqueous samples. The binding measurements and characterization will be performed using commercially available instrument systems. In the second aim, C1q protein will be modified with a redox-active molecule for measuring using voltammetry-based electrochemical sensor, as it is a simple, robust, and mature technology. If the project is successful, it is expected to be broadly applicable to many sensing application with the potential to develop a low-cost, portable electrochemical sensing platform.

Typical customers for the proposed innovation include a broad spectrum of high-tech industries which will potentially benefit from commercialization of this technology. Some examples include fuel cell manufacturers, automotive industry, consumer electronics and energy storage companies. Superior performance of novel amorphous catalysts compared to state of the art suggests that this technology might be attractive core strength for a new company.

Metallic glasses are fully amorphous multi-component alloys with unique combination of properties and processing ability. They can be produced in a wide range of compositions that are not available in crystalline form and therefore their electronic and catalytic characteristics can be engineered to achieve superior performance. A self-supporting architecture will be used for these novel amorphous catalysts, which prevent the dissolution of support material and significantly improve durability.

This I-Corps project can lead to the adoption of the new decision-making technology that incorporates unique predictive algorithms to help management teams in long-term care facilities maximize the information from their currently collected safety and clinical data. By adopting this new technology, management teams will be able to predict where there may be deficiencies, prioritize key drivers associated with specific patient outcomes, and prevent adverse events.

The algorithm provides a stable framework for improvement that is not sensitive to data imperfections and does not allow those imperfections to distract decision-making from real priorities. The algorithm was developed based on extensive research and practice of applying the Rasch model and objective standard-setting process in different settings, including health, psychology and transportation. The most extensive of these applications were the development of rigorous risk and defensibility assessments for long-term care facilities and hospitals, and the development of differentiation algorithms for passenger experience in the airline industry.","03/28/2017","03/28/2017","1735683","Fox","Christine","chris.fox@utoledo.edu","03/28/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Toledo","TOLEDO","436063390","4195302844","2801 W Bancroft St., MS 944","United States","Ohio","OH","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Svetlana","Beltyukova","Svetlana.Beltyukova@utoledo.edu","03/28/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aircraft design is interdisciplinary, and important considerations include aerodynamic load computations and external surface design. There are many physical factors and parameters that must be considered in different design stages, such as, 1). Fast conceptual or preliminary designs with approximate parameter estimations; 2). Prototype development; 3) Optimizations. An improved development of an aircraft design can create many benefits, e.g., optimal control surfaces can enhance maneuverability; save long term airplane operation cost; and improve the missile strike accuracy. This software package offers fast and accurate estimations on different performances from the size, geometry, numbers, and locations of small aircraft control surfaces. The package can help aerospace design engineers to perform fast preliminary designs with correct inclusions of physical parameters as well as to perform accurate computations for late stage optimizations. The product may significantly reduce demands on labor, time, space, materials and devices compared to current design methods.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops an improved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling software based on groups of air molecules and their collective behaviors. This overcomes limitations of most CFD packages, which assume dense gas flows, when applied to high altitude applications where air is dilute and rarefication effects should be considered. The process developed here also overcomes typical limitations of single molecule dynamics where the simulation results are accurate but slow, making them impractical for most engineering applications. The simulation techniques developed here can be fast and have rarefication effects properly included. By using this proposed software packages, accurate databases can be established, with many combinations of size, shape, locations, and number of control surfaces.

Each team's administrator will be encouraged to attend sessions led by administrators who have supported reform, and these leaders will share advice, successful strategies, and ways to overcome common obstacles. Prior to departure from the Institute, each team will develop an action plan to target improvements in their program for the next academic year and beyond. The project's assessment plan, developed in partnership with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), will include feedback on the structure and function of the Institute as well as evaluation of each team's progress based on data collected before, during and after the SERP Institute. Teams will also be encouraged to use particular assessment tools to evaluate student learning outcomes and dispositions as well as changes in faculty teaching practices and attitudes. Each team will provide an update on their progress during a poster discussion session at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists (which occurs ten months after the Institute), and the southeast PULSE Fellows will present the results of this project at the annual Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS-COC) Conference, the AAC&U STEM Conference, disciplinary conferences, a publication in CBE-Life Sciences Education, and via the http://www.pulsecommunity.org website.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1723614","Ellen","Goldey","goldeyes@wofford.edu","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","Florida Atlantic University","BOCA RATON","334316424","5612970777","777 GLADES RD","United States","Florida","FL","1664","Research Coordination Networks","7916","EAGER","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8015",NA,NA,NA,"BIO Innovation Activities",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to the safety-critical nature of these cyber-physical systems, their safe and reliable operation is essential. The reliable and correct operation of development tools used to design cyber-physical systems is also vital, since defects in development tools have the capability to culminate in defects in cyber-physical systems themselves. While extensive research efforts exist to address problems such as state-space explosion for models of cyber-physical systems, less effort has been invested in developing methods to ensure correctness of development environments for cyber-physical systems. The design and engineering process for cyber-physical systems (CPS) relies on numerous artifacts, model translation layers, programming languages, and development tools, which are often assumed to be correct but are in fact not. <br/><br/>This project develops randomized differential testing and fuzzing methods to automatically find candidate defects in CPS development environments. The project investigates new formal methods and testing approaches to automate improvement of CPS development environments. This framework relies on three primary efforts: randomly generating CPS models, translating CPS models between different development tools, and comparing both dynamic and symbolic executions of CPS models. The framework increases confidence in the correctness of development environments which aids in realizing the societal benefits of cyber-physical systems.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1736323","Taylor","Johnson","taylor.johnson@gmail.com","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","Vanderbilt University","Nashville","372350002","6153222631","Sponsored Programs Administratio","United States","Tennessee","TN","6892","CI REUSE","7923","SMALL PROJECT","8206","Formal Methods and Verification","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7798",NA,NA,NA,"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although this study focuses on a wearable textile material for use specifically in cutaneous sensing applications, these same materials will have broader implications for public health since they can be used for a variety of sensing or device applications. The materials developed in this work could be functionalized for the detection of a wide variety of biomarkers and such innovations could profoundly impact our ability to diagnosis, treat, and prevent diseases, from analysis of common diabetic neurological complications to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). These materials could also be used in smart clothing to allow for biomonitoring in advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking. Development of a wearable sensing material capable of determining physiological parameters at the surface of skin could also make construction of health monitoring sensor arrays relatively easy and inexpensive.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on innovative, textile-based sensing materials capable of continuous monitoring of biomarkers in sweat, which could have significant impact on the field of biomedical monitoring. These sensing materials would be better than current sensors as they could provide continuous information about a person's health based on a molecular level analysis of sweat biomarkers in a flexible, lightweight device that could be worn in any application without discomfort. This technology can provide reliable, real-time monitoring of dehydration (sodium ions), muscle fatigue (lactic acid), and temperature in cutaneous sweat. These sensors are made of functionalized carbon nanotube nanocomposites with an electrospun polymer base. One sensor, using a polypyrrole functionalization, has been demonstrated to measure temperature in a physiologically relevant range (25-45 degrees Celsius). Selective nanocomposite materials functionalized with calixarene can selectively measure sodium ions in synthetic sweat, without ionic interference; while, nanocomposite materials functionalized with lactate oxidase have been demonstrated to selectively measure lactic acid without glucose interference.

Traditionally the mathematical processes used to analyze potential designs are very linear in nature, and do not offer the manufacturer a complete picture of the overall impacts of the non-linear parts of their designs. With the predictive engineering analysis tool developed here, a manufacturing facility can preview the results available from using a particular engineering design prior to the actual manufacturing and testing of the physical parts. Design parameters and environmental conditions can also be inserted into the tool which are then used to better predict the behavior of the part after it is produced. This innovative virtual tool has the potential to be added to the set of existing design and testing tools already being used and let manufacturers predict the success or failure of a part. The impact of this tool would be decreased time to market, eliminating the guesswork now used in certain aspects of a design and saving valuable physical resources.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project defines an innovative scalable software tool that is capable of virtually predicting the success or failure of an engineering design prior to production. The technique is based on the mathematical modeling of the coordinated behaviors of biological system. This allows the tool to quickly search and intelligently predict the best solution sets to a multi-objective problem in a given design space. This project employs these innovative bio-inspired techniques to develop algorithms which are applied to engineering designs to produce an ideal set of solutions based on user defined objectives. Bio-inspired algorithms have been shown to improve upon current standard rigid mathematical techniques. This project provides the flexibility to implement an approach that is able to search the entire problem space at once therefore giving better visibility to all of the possible solutions. Since no particular parameter in isolation impacts the outcome of the algorithm, the user is presented with the opportunity to shift the input parameters and rerun the optimization. Further this I-Corps project attempts to explore and define the input parameters for a variety of industries, and assist the end user in coming up with better designs for their products.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1737815","Devinder","Kaur","devinder.kaur@utoledo.edu","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Toledo","TOLEDO","436063390","4195302844","2801 W Bancroft St., MS 944","United States","Ohio","OH","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oil spills are typically expensive to remediate due to the equipment, time, and manpower required. Consequently, most remediation approaches are focused on large-scale spill events. However, these account for only approximately 5% of the total pollution in waterways. Small-scale spills occur much more frequently but are often ignored because existing cleanup technologies are inefficient to deploy. The 3D printed oil absorbent technology to be explored in this project uniquely address this need by delivering customized absorbent capacity and the ability to be produced on-demand to maximize recovery for a broad range incidents via customization toward the unique combination of oil properties, quantity, and environmental and weather conditions at each spill site.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of a family of 3D printable oleophilic materials capable of absorbing and retaining oil within specially designed internal pore networks. These absorbent materials also leverage shape memory behavior, making it possible for the absorbed oil to be extracted and recovered by heating the material to a prescribed temperature at which it automatically contracts to squeeze out the collected oil. In this way, the absorbent materials can be made to function like a self-wringing sponge. These materials are produced using poly(lactic acid), an inexpensive commodity biopolymer that is degradable and environmentally friendly. This technology emerged from fundamental research performed in a prior NSF-sponsored project, where optimal pore network designs and processing conditions were identified to maximize recovery of different petroleum samples dispersed in water. 3D printing enables on-demand production of designer absorbent architectures that match properties of different petroleum fractions, maximize selectivity against water, and permit either strong encapsulation or easy recovery of the collected oil.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1740388","Victor","Ugaz","ugaz@tamu.edu","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station","College Station","778454645","9798477635","TEES State Headquarters Bldg.","United States","Texas","TX","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This fluid collection and transfer technology reduces fluid splash and splatter during fluid collection and eliminates the need for a needle and syringe system during transfer thereby eliminating haphazard and dangerous methods currently in use. These procedures are thereby rendered safer by reducing the risk of potentially infectious fluid exposures and by reducing the risk of needle stick injuries.

The core technology was originally developed for inexpensive heat shields for space vehicles. It can now be used for complex heat exchangers or for hot-section components for aviation and power generation engines, or for radiation resistant liners in nuclear applications. In all these applications, the proposed technology can reduce the original equipment cost while improving performance and reliability, or can be used to reduce replacements cost of original metal-based components. When applied to aviation or power generation, the net benefit can in the form of lower emissions from the engines, and lower cost of flying or lower electricity cost due to both lower fuel cost and lower maintenance cost. As the underlying manufacturing technology has significant overlap with that for polymer composite structures such as boat hulls or wind turbines, manufacturing personnel employed in such traditional industries can be easily retrained for manufacturing of high-value added, hot-section components for capital goods such as gas turbine engines for aviation and power generation.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Project focuses on potential applications of a relatively new type of high-temperature structural materials, known as Polymer Derived Ceramic Composite (PDCC). PDCC fabrication is inexpensive as it involves similar fabrication techniques as other polymer composite structures like wind turbine blades or boat hulls. However, ceramic fiber and special resin are to be used for PDCC. Currently available resin-fiber combinations offer maximum use temperatures between 1200C and 1700C, depending on the choice of ceramic fibers. This maximum use temperature is much higher than creep-onset temperatures of common high-temperature alloys. The PDCC process is significantly less inexpensive compared to many monolithic ceramics or alternative ceramic matrix composite processes. Also, use of appropriate molds during formation of the polymeric state can lead to relatively complex shapes. PDCC?s share the typical properties of other ceramics, such as corrosion resistance or radiation tolerance.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1740524","Jayanta","Kapat","jkapat@mail.ucf.edu","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Central Florida","ORLANDO","328168005","4078230387","4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD","United States","Florida","FL","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mixed-status families have, by definition, family members of different legal statuses, such as undocumented, semi-legal, or citizen. For Latino mixed-status families, the spillover consequences of current enforcement practices and limited options for regularizing their legal status include family separation, economic strain, and low educational attainment as well as problems with mental health and cognitive development. Previous studies on mixed-status families homogenize Latinos as a pan-ethnic group, blurring intragroup differences and ignoring long histories of colonization, discrimination, and resistance efforts of Indigenous- and Afro-Latino groups. To fill this gap, this project explores Indigenous (Mixteco and Tlapaneco) and non-Indigenous Latino mixed-status families' experiences and investigates the consequences for family dynamics, individual identity, and community engagement. Research involving immigrant families is typically conducted in cities in the West, East, and Southwest parts of the U.S., traditional destinations for immigrant populations. This project takes place in Kansas, allowing for a critical examination of the effects of structural arrangements in this specific context on mixed-status families. <br/><br/>Using an intersectional analysis and sociolegal scholarship on immigration policy, this research asks: (1) How does the intersection of structural inequalities based on race, class, gender, and legal status shape mixed-status families' experiences in Kansas? and (2) How do mixed-status family members manage risk, negotiate their legally vulnerable lives, and respond to their conditions? A qualitative study of sixty in-depth interviews with Indigenous (Mixteco and Tlapaneco) and non-Indigenous Latino mixed-status family members and a year-long participant observation in social gatherings, cultural events, and pro-immigration protests in east-central Kansas constitute the main sources of data to investigate these questions. This project gives a voice to a highly marginalized group--mixed-status Indigenous (Mixteco and Tlapaneco) and non-Indigenous Latino families, showing not only how structures affect their livelihoods, but also how they negotiate and contest systems of power and oppression.

The study will focus on Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes--the two Louisiana parishes adjacent to the mouth of the Mississippi River. The study will investigate residents' attitudes on climate change and assess the relationship between these attitudes and local environmental policy. This region is of specific interest due to the unique configuration of social and environmental factors that impact the community, including environmental risk, economic dependence on extractive industry, high rates of climate change denial, and high concentration of oil and gas employment. This study will challenge dominant perspectives on climate skepticism by incorporating economic, cultural, and emotional factors into the discourse on climate change denial. By contributing to a more complete and nuanced understanding of climate change denial, this study will have potentially transformative impacts on the future of climate discourse and policy by providing new tools for climate advocates to address climate denial in the political arena.<br/><br/>The study will focus on the central questions of how residents interpret the relationship between environmental security and economic prosperity in their community, and how the negotiation of these two social priorities plays out in local political processes. Residents of southeast Louisiana regularly experience environmental harm yet remain bound economically to industries that exploit the local environment. While environmental awareness is common, climate change denial is persistent in the community. The theory of socially organized denial, which explores social dimensions of climate change denial, will be applied to investigate the origins of these attitudes and factors that perpetuate widespread climate skepticism in the region. This study will utilize content analysis and semi-structured interviews to better understand local interpretations of the relationship between economy and environment. The content analysis phase of the study will utilize local print media to establish a discursive field within which attitudes form on environmental issues. The interview phase of the project will utilize responses from a broad sample of respondents in the community. The interviews will focus on several themes including news acquisition, political attitudes, attitudes toward local economic issues, attitudes toward environmental issues such as coastal restoration and climate change, and attitudes regarding the political processes around these issues in the community. The combination of these methods will allow the researchers to contextualize respondents' testimony within public environmental discourse, yielding rich data that will facilitate a deep exploration of local environmental attitudes and politics.","03/29/2017","03/29/2017","1703120","Eric","Hanley","hanley@ku.edu","03/29/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Kansas Center for Research Inc","LAWRENCE","660457568","7858643441","2385 IRVING HILL RD","United States","Kansas","KS","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jacob","Lipsman","jlipsman@ku.edu","03/29/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Before cotton?s fluffy heads (""bolls"") emerge, the plant produces large white flowers that attract insects, which visit the flowers to collect food (nectar and pollen) and to act as pollinators, moving pollen between flowers. While cotton plants can produce marketable bolls without the help of pollinating insects, pollinators greatly increase the size of bolls, with larger bolls producing greater yields and higher profits for growers. However, as human activities transform cotton-growing landscapes, there is concern that cotton fields are becoming are inhospitable to pollinators, preventing them from moving between fields in search of food and sites to reproduce. If this is happening, pollinators may disappear along with their valuable pollination services. The first steps in conserving cotton pollinators and the services they provide are to identify which insects are the best pollinators, and which human activities may be preventing them from persisting in rapidly-changing landscapes. This project will accomplish these first steps.<br/><br/>Using the tools of landscape genetics and ecology, this research looks for ways to restore and maintain pollinators in agricultural landscapes. Through behavioral observation, single visit pollen deposition, pollen load analysis, and the estimation of visitation frequency, researchers will determine the efficacy of all cotton pollinators. They will then use next generation genetic sequencing techniques to determine the population dynamics of the three most effective pollinator species as a function of landscape composition. The goal is to identify specific landscape barriers that may hamper pollinator dispersal and colonization. This research will develop genomic resources to investigate pollinator dispersal, migration, and colonization, which will in turn offer an opportunity to increase crop yields and profits while also benefiting the environment.

These ""tick-borne"" diseases can be very harmful, causing illnesses, deaths, and economic losses. To prevent and reduce tick-borne diseases, it is important to understand how risk of passing on these diseases may differ among geographic regions and times of year. Because ticks live outside, their ability to survive and reproduce is likely affected by rainfall and temperature. In climates where ticks survive well, there may be a higher chance of them carrying and passing on diseases. This research will help determine how climate affects the risk of tick-borne disease by examining tick activity and survival across different climates and times of year. The study sites are close to each other yet have very different climates, providing a rare opportunity to examine the effects of climate on ticks and tick-borne diseases. Results of this project can be used to develop public health programs aimed at preventing or reducing the spread of tick-borne disease.<br/><br/>This research will evaluate how abiotic and biotic variables affect spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of ticks and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens across central Panama. To fully characterize the effects of climate on tick-borne disease risk, researchers will integrate field sampling of ticks and wildlife hosts with pathogen analysis and climate modeling. They will then construct a comprehensive model to quantify the abiotic and biotic pathways by which climate variables determine the frequency of tick-borne diseases across the region. The model will inform regional policy and public health decisions and will provide a broad framework upon which other climate and tick-borne disease studies may be built.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701777","Brian","Allan","ballan@illinois.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Erin","Welsh","ewelsh2@illinois.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We already know that different species have different requirements to survive, grow, and reproduce. For example, some trees can thrive in the shade whereas others need lots of sunlight. These light-loving trees are called ""pioneer"" species because they are usually the first to colonize open areas after a disturbance topples large trees that once grew there. How do their seeds get there? Either they are dispersed after an area becomes sunny or they are dispersed much earlier, become buried in the soil, and ""wait"" for trees above them to die. In both cases, plants often rely on animals to move their seeds. Ants are one of the most important seed dispersers because they both move seeds and ""plant"" them in the soil. Most of what scientists know about seed dispersal by ants comes from studies investigating seeds that provide a food reward for the ants. However, most plant seeds, including those of most commercially important crops, do not provide a food reward for ants. The scientists doing this study have discovered that ants may move these types of seeds, despite the lack of a reward. They think that ants are chemically ""tricked"" to carry seeds that smell good but can't be eaten. The goal of this project is to test this idea and figure out what the good-smelling chemicals may be. Results will help land managers understand how plants move into new places, which is an important process in forest restoration. <br/><br/>This research will use a tropical tree species and a common, ground-dwelling ant to determine possible chemical cues that promote seed dispersal. The approach includes fractioning, identifying, synthesizing, and field-testing seed extracts to identify which chemicals attract ants. Seed extracts will be tested both in tropical and temperate environments to help determine which species engage in ant-mediated seed dispersal. The results will help guide strategies for plant conservation, restoration, and invasive species management. In addition, a graduate student will be mentored in laboratory techniques and field research.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701501","Andrew","Suarez","avsuarez@life.uiuc.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Selina","Ruzi","sruzi24@gmail.com","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This movement, known as ""dispersal"", is important in ecology because it largely determines where species are found, which species come in contact with each other, and the services they can then provide to nature and to humans. Sometimes, plants depend on animals for dispersal. Many trees and shrubs, for example, rely on birds to eat their fruits and defecate their seeds somewhere else. Mosses may also rely on birds for dispersal of spores, which are like seeds, but practically nothing is known about it. Researchers will study how often spores are found on the feathers of birds and whether the spores are actually dispersed by the birds. Mosses play an important role in ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling, maintaining water, and providing nesting material and places to forage for many forest animals. By understanding the relationship between moss dispersal and bird behavior, managers and policy makers will have a more complete picture of how land use decisions influence the use and conservation of natural resources.<br/><br/>Dispersal is a key process shaping ecological communities over time. Behaviorally-mediated dispersal via an association with an animal vector can greatly increase the chances of arriving in a favorable locale. While the impact of avian dispersal of seed plants has been widely studied and is known to impact dispersal outcomes, avian dispersal of bryophyte spores has received little attention. Preliminary work has shown that bryophyte spores are present on a wide variety of bird species, and that these spores are viable. In addition, there is evidence for species-specific relationships between birds and bryophytes. Building on this work, this project has two aims: 1) to determine how behaviorally-directed dispersal by birds differs from bulk spore flow via wind, and 2) to determine the topical retention time of spores on birds. Results from the second aim will be incorporated into a model of flight distance times to address the likelihood of long distance spore dispersal by birds. Together, these aims will enhance understanding of bryophyte dispersal ecology and will provide a comparative model that can be used to test theories developed in tracheophytes.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701756","Sarah","Eppley","eppley@pdx.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Portland State University","Portland","972070751","5037259900","1600 SW 4th Ave","United States","Oregon","OR","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matthew","Chmielewski","chmiel@pdx.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Number theory is discrete and geometry is continuous, but continuous structures can be fruitfully approximated by discrete structures through finer and finer approximations. Intermediate discrete models can exhibit both (discrete) number theoretic and (continuous) geometric properties. In this way, number theory connects with discrete geometric structures, via packings, leading to connections with problems in materials science. Certain finite discrete models in large sizes have parallels with exactly solvable models in physics that exhibit phase transitions when a temperature parameter is varied, as between water and ice. The projects in this proposal investigate a number of specific problems related to these analogies in order to bridge the discrete and the continuous in various limits. This work will lead to fruitful interactions with researchers in geometry, physics and material science and will support the training of graduate students in number theory and in discrete geometry.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will investigate several topics relating number theory and geometry. The first, and main, topic continues the investigation of the Lerch zeta function, which is a function of three variables, that on specializing variables yields both the Hurwitz zeta function and the Riemann zeta function. This research is based on a recently discovered connection between these functions and representations of the real Heisenberg group and related solvable groups. The project will study generalizations of the Lerch zeta function to automorphic representations of various higher-dimensional Lie groups, via zeta integrals. A second topic concerns the study of various discrete finite models of arithmetic structures, typically with two variables, and the study of statistics of such models as their size increases, pursuing an analogy with integrable systems in statistical mechanics. A third topic concerns intra-universal Teichmuller theory introduced by Mochizuki. This new theory will be reformulated from a more accessible analytic perspective. A fourth topic concerns circle packings on Riemann surfaces. The PI will study scaling limits of perfect finite circle packings in two directions: a complex variables limit and a Diophantine approximation limit. These limits will be determined precisely.

Palka","Geometric tomography is the area of mathematics in which one investigates geometric properties of solids based on the information about sections and projections of these solids. One of the examples, x-ray tomography, has numerous applications in science, medicine, and engineering. Within mathematics, geometric tomography overlaps with convex geometry and functional analysis. The principal investigator has recently discovered that important problems in the area of geometric tomography can be solved using the most popular tool of harmonic analysis, the Fourier transform. This tool allows one to decompose data into a simple combination of harmonics (i.e., into functions with periodically repeating values) and, by doing this, to reduce geometric problems to computations related to the harmonics, the theory of which is well developed. This approach has led to analytic solutions of several longstanding problems in the area, including the Busemann-Petty problem, the Shephard problem, and the slicing problem for sections of proportional dimensions. In this project, the principal investigator plans to apply the Fourier approach to several types of problems. Volume comparison problems ask what kind of data about sections or projections is necessary to conclude that the volume of one body is greater than the volume of another body. Volume difference problems ask how errors in the data related to plane sections or projections of a solid affect the computation of the volume of this solid. Slicing problems are concerned with bounds for the volume of a solid in terms of the areas of its slices through the center. The principal investigator expects that methods developed in this project will also be applicable to several problems in functional analysis and probability, in particular to the study of stable random processes (i.e., random laws inheriting the self-reproducing property of the normal law). Stable laws are frequently used in statistics. An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The problems considered in this project belong to several areas of mathematics: geometric tomography, convex geometry, functional analysis, and probability. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results: the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. In geometric tomography the principal investigator plans to apply Fourier methods to stability and separation in volume comparison problems, namely, volume difference and slicing inequalities for the section, projection, and curvature functions. In particular, he plans to study quantitative versions of the Busemann-Petty problem, which asks whether convex bodies with uniformly smaller areas of central plane sections in all directions necessarily have smaller volumes. He also plans to continue his work on the slicing problem of Bourgain. Another direction of research in the project is a connection between convex geometry and functional analysis. The principal investigator has recently found that intersection bodies, one of the main objects of interest in convex geometry, can be considered as the unit balls of certain Lebesgue spaces. He plans to apply this connection to the problem of duality between intersection and projection bodies, as well as to the problem of estimating the distance from an arbitrary convex body to the classes of intersection and projection bodies. Yet another direction of research is related to a problem in probability theory going back to Levy. The problem is to characterize random vectors having the property that all linear combinations of their coordinates have the same distribution, up to a constant. A conjecture is that the only vectors with this property are mixtures of stable random vectors. The principal investigator has already made several contributions in this direction, including a solution of a 1938 problem of Schoenberg, but the main question remains open.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1700036","Alexander","Koldobsky","koldobskiya@missouri.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Missouri-Columbia","COLUMBIA","652110001","5738827560","115 Business Loop 70 W","United States","Missouri","MO","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some of these forces are attractive, some are repulsive. For instance, the formation of crystals, which are periodic arrangements of atoms, can be very roughly explained via repulsive forces coupled with a binding force. This project takes a mathematical and general view on a class of such phenomena: given a system of N points (or particles) with a specific repulsive interaction (typically the Coulomb repulsive force encountered in electrostatics, or other interactions which are in inverse power of the distance between two points), together with a confining force, one would like to describe the typical macroscopic and microscopic behavior of the system as the number of points N gets very large, and possible thermal effects are included (temperature being expected to add disorder to the system). The research of the PI is concretely related to important physics models: the arrangements of vortices in superconductors, the study of energy-levels of large atoms (spectrum of large random matrices), theoretical physics models related to magnetism, but also more loosely connected to questions in biology, astrophysics, plasma physics, Bose-Einstein condensates, atomic clusters or hydrodynamics.<br/><br/>The first topic of the project is the statistical mechanics of Coulomb gases in an external potential and related models. This is motivated by random matrices, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and even approximation theory. One is interested in describing the macroscopic (mean-field) and microscopic arrangements of the many particles as their number N tends to infinity, and how they depend on temperature and the potential, and in particular whether some features are universal (i.e. independent of the potential) and whether there are phase transitions as the temperature varies. Recent works of the PI and collaborators have given insight into these questions with a proof that the fluctuations of the distribution of particles in a two-dimensional Coulomb gas converge to a Gaussian Free Field, and a Large Deviation Principle result which characterizes the limiting point processes at the microscopic scale as minimizing a certain rate function. With these results, one expects that the system should ""crystallize"" into a triangular lattice as the temperature tends to 0.The methods previously developed open the way to treating several important related questions: the case of higher-dimensional Coulomb gases, the case of more general interactions, the universality of the local statistics, the existence of a limiting point process, and the description of its long-range correlations. The second topic is that of vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity, with pinning terms that introduce disorder and the final topic is to advance the analysis of mean-field dynamics for the simplest setting of many particles interacting via a repulsive singular interaction, a notoriously difficult question.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1700278","Sylvia","Serfaty","serfaty@cims.nyu.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","New York University","NEW YORK","100121019","2129982121","70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S","United States","New York","NY","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research will involve undergraduates and includes outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>The work is driven by the hypothesis that the monitoring and control of cranes can be performed autonomously using robotics and computer vision algorithms, and that detailed and continuous monitoring and control feedback can lead to improved planning and simulation of equipment operations. It will particularly focus on developing methods for (a) planning construction operations while accounting for safety hazards through simulation; (b) estimating and providing analytics on the state of the equipment; (c) monitoring equipment surrounding the crane operating environment, including detection of safety hazards, and proximity analysis to dynamic resources including materials, equipment, and workers; (d) controlling crane stability in real-time; and (e) providing feedback to the user and equipment operators in a ""transparent cockpit"" using visual and haptic cues. It will address the underlying research challenges by improving the efficiency and reliability of planning through failure effects analysis and creating methods for contact state estimation and equilibrium analysis; improving monitoring through model-driven and real-time 3D reconstruction techniques, context-driven object recognition, and forecasting motion trajectories of objects; enhancing reliability of control through dynamic crane models, measures of instability, and algorithms for finding optimal controls; and, finally, improving efficiency of feedback loops through methods for providing visual and haptic cues.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1729209","Chinemelu","Anumba","anumba@ufl.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Florida","GAINESVILLE","326112002","3523923516","1 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","United States","Florida","FL","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","030E","CONTROL SYSTEMS","034E","Dynamical systems","5188","SAFETY","7339","COMPUTER VISION","7918","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)","8235","CPS-Synergy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hazelrigg","This award provides support for a workshop to convene an interdisciplinary team of scholars to identify promising research directions for applications of operations research (OR) and data analytics aimed at the disruption of illicit supply networks such as human trafficking. The United States Department of State considers human trafficking a form of modern-day slavery and broadly defines it to be when a person is deceived or coerced in situations of prostitution, forced labor, or domestic servitude. Human trafficking is a key example of illicit networks that operate in and to the detriment of society. Other examples include arms trafficking, drug trafficking, animal trafficking, and human smuggling. By bringing together scholars from disparate disciplines, the goal of the workshop is to identify new research approaches and breakthrough strategies for disrupting the illicit networks commonly found in human trafficking.<br/><br/>The workshop, which will consist of two meetings, the first to be held at The University of Texas at Austin and the second to be held in Washington, DC, will enable scholars from operations research, management science, analytics, machine learning, and data science to exchange ideas and outline a potential research agenda for the development of disruptive interventions against illicit networks. The agenda developed at this workshop will help move understanding of such illicit systems from descriptive characterization and predictive estimation toward improved dynamic operational control. OR and data analytics are fields ideally suited to bring this perspective to the study of illicit networks. Few studies have approached this problem from a dynamic systems theoretical perspective that allows the social justice challenge to be represented as a mathematical system that can be analyzed in terms of decision variables to help guide, control, and constrain behavioral dynamics toward desired goals. Solutions to remediate the effect of illicit networks are inherently interdisciplinary, typically involving the fields of criminal justice, social work, social science, economics, healthcare, and law. Such systems are dynamic and exploit and victimize members of the community. What is more, they involve both legal and illicit activities at the same time, which often obscures criminal activity from law enforcement. These systems can be hierarchical, nonstationary networks of interconnected activities and participants that involve intersectional decision making by perpetrators, victims, and/or bystanders. Highly common among such systems is a paucity of data due in large part to the hidden aspects of the crime and the partial observability of the population of interest. The workshop aims include examining the structure and nature of illicit networks within an analytic and modeling framework; exploring the form and complexity of viable, real-world solutions using OR methodologies; assessing the characteristics and amount of data needed to model and analyze the problem; proposing a research agenda to guide the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of scholars to develop methods and solutions; and initiating and facilitating ongoing interactions among workshop attendees and their research collaborators, including junior investigators and graduate students.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1726895","Noel","Busch-Armendariz","nbusch@austin.utexas.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","006Y","OE Operations Engineering","073E","OPTIMIZATION & DECISION MAKING","1372","LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES","5514","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matt","Kammer-Kerwick","mattkk@ic2.utexas.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","1372",NA,NA,NA,"LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This international travel grant will be used to support eight U.S. students on a field mission to Japan to observe the reconstruction and redevelopment of the Tohoku region, after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. This Learn from Disasters Field Mission (LDFM) two-week summer experience will train and mentor traditionally underrepresented minority and female students. Student participants will learn firsthand the process necessary to recover from a natural disaster. They will also visit sites within the Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures to observe the recovery efforts and attend workshops hosted by local Japanese universities. Further, the workshops and site visits will provide broad exposure to disaster recovery and community resilience research in Japan while also allowing the U.S. student participants to establish meaningful relationships with Japanese engineering students and researchers. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of the LDFM program is to develop a cadre of well-trained future engineers who will develop a strong foundation in engineering and disaster recovery while also gaining the capacity to engage successfully in international research within academia or industry. Further, this travel grant will provide a unique opportunity for engineering underrepresented students to receive firsthand experience in the field of disaster recovery and natural hazard mitigation. The LDFM program will further stimulate students' interest in pursuing advanced degrees in engineering and greatly enhance their future careers in engineering. Moreover, this travel grant will foster new international collaborative opportunities in hazard mitigation and disaster recovery for the principal investigator and will promote global learning and cultural exchange among the student participants.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1734772","Terri","Norton","tnorton3@unl.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Lincoln","685031435","4024723171","151 Prem S.

The project will focus on connections between Logic, on the one hand, and Topology and Combinatorics, on the other. It will aim at connecting Fraisse theory, an amalgamation theory from Logic, with deep questions on homogeneity of the generic continuum and with possible development of a homology theory. Further, it will aim at establishing connections between Ramsey theory, a branch of Combinatorics, with Topological Dynamics, Algebraic Topology, and certain orders playing an important role in parts of Set Theory.<br/><br/><br/>The project will develop a presentation of Ramsey theory in terms of algebraic topological notions - simplicial<br/>complexes and simplicial maps. This presentation should incorporate both finite and infinite Ramsey theory, and it should capture Ramsey theoretic statements associated with amenability of subgroups of the permutation group of the set of natural numbers. The project will also uncover implications of the dynamics of monoid actions to Ramsey theory. The project will also explore an approach to certain problems in topological dynamics and topology that uses purely combinatorial/model theoretic methods. Some important compact topological spaces are obtained as canonical quotients of generic inverse limits of families of finite structures - projective Fraisse limits. Topological homogeneity questions will be investigated using such presentations. Another aim will be to develop the right notion of the simplex and the boundary operation for homology theory of projective Fraisse limits. The test case here is the development of universal Menger compacta through projective Fraisse limits. Another goal of the project is to explore connections between a fixed point property of group actions, concentration of measure phenomenon, and geometry of submeasures.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1700426","Slawomir","Solecki","ssolecki@math.uiuc.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1268","FOUNDATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Similarly, the fact that some species are expanding their ranges rapidly (e.g., invasive species) while many are not remains difficult to explain. Figuring out what enables, or prevents, plants from growing in certain areas has far reaching consequences for management of invasive species, continued productivity of crops in variable environments, and protection of threatened organisms. This project uses a Californian plant species, (Clarkia xantiana), restricted to a small area of Southern California to explore the environmental factors limiting species distributions. Studies often only consider climatic factors, such as temperature and precipitation, as drivers of these distributions. But researchers are increasingly realizing the role microorganisms play in affecting plant growth and distribution. This project will characterize soil microbial communities within and outside C. xantiana's native range, and use a novel field experiment to test how microbes and rainfall may interact to limit C. xantiana's range. The researchers will also conduct a series of educational field trips with a local middle school to teach students about hypothesis testing, scientific experiments, and the natural history of Southern California. <br/><br/>This project uses next generation sequencing and a manipulative field experiment to explore interactions between soil microbial communities, precipitation, and plant traits, and how these factors influence the geographic distribution of Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana in the foothills of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Multivariate statistical analyses will be used to examine patterns of community shifts across geographic space, focusing on those microbial taxa differentiating sites within and outside C. xantiana's distributional limit. An in situ soil microbial transplant experiment, paired with a rainfall manipulation treatment, will quantify the main and interactive effects of these factors on fitness outside the range. PVC growth cores installed in the ground at sites outside the range edge will be used to manipulate local soil microbial environments surrounding individual xantiana plants via inoculation with microbial communities from inside the range. This is paired with a rainfall manipulation treatment in a split-plot design, where half of the plots will receive 50% rainfall addition. The effects of site, rainfall treatment, inoculum, and all two-way interactions on components of lifetime fitness and phenology will be analyzed using ANOVA.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701072","David","Moeller","moeller@umn.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"John","Benning","jbenning@umn.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the development of the Black Guerilla Family and the Aryan Brotherhood in the California prison system as comparative case studies, the project will answer four interrelated questions: (1) How does social control in the prison organizational field coercively influence prison gang development? (2) What coercive processes propel conflict or cohesion between racial groups in prison and how does this impact prison gang development? (3) How does an organization?s relationship to prison staff affect their development? and (4) How do social, political, and economic changes in society affect the prison organizational field and its influence on prison gang development? Understanding the prison organizational field and its connections with prison gang development will provide support for improving prison conditions and reducing the discriminate use of extreme punishment techniques such as indeterminate solitary confinement. Study results will also contribute to our understanding of the consequences of deprivation and racial coercion on staff-prisoner and prisoner-prisoner relations, revealing how prisoner and staff efforts to mitigate risk and manage threats can actually lead to cyclical, racialized violence and fuel prison gang development.<br/><br/>The project takes a comparative historical approach and uses 42 interviews and approximately 600 archival documents about the prison environment and prison gangs in Northern California, social and political movements in California, and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The investigator will conduct 28 interviews to expand a preliminary dataset that consists of (A) 14 interviews with Black Guerilla Family founders and early members, formerly incarcerated men in Northern California, and social and political activists from the Bay Area and (B) archival documents and surveys collected from 8 archives: California State Archives, UC-Berkeley?s Bancroft Library, Stanford University?s Green Library, Golden State University School of Law Digital Archive, the Freedom Archives, Michigan State University Black Panther Archive, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Vault, and the It?s About Time Black Panther Archive. These documents include federal investigations, internal CDCR investigations and memos, California legislative hearings, prison incident reports, prisoner letters and private correspondence, prisoner newsletters, reports from social and political organizations, prisoner and prison staff memoirs, federal court case transcripts, and state court case transcripts. The additional 28 interviews will be conducted with members of the Black Guerilla Family, the Aryan Brotherhood, correctional officers, and formerly incarcerated men. The project is divided into three time periods to ascertain how these processes affect prison gang development over time. The time periods examined are 1961-1971, 1971-1990, and 1990-2000, which allow the study to measure organizational development across the turbulent social and political change of the 1960s, the war on drugs and the massive influx of prisoners in California in the 1970s and 1980s, and the effects of mass incarceration as seen in the 1990s.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1703056","John","Hagan","jhagan@abfn.org","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brittany","Friedman","BrittanyFriedman2019@u.northwestern.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The National Science Board recently named SEA the recipient of its 2016 Public Service Award for making a substantial contribution to increasing public understanding of science and engineering. NSF recognizes that many SEA alumni are professionals working and teaching in the marine sciences and related fields and for that reason have allowed for limited support through the SSSE Program. The panel considered this when it evaluated the requests and found unlike the Instrumentation Proposal, there were several items here that were poorly explained and that the whole proposal was a bit unclear. The overall rating was Good-Very Good. That said it is clear that SEA needs overboarding sheaves. Their top priority was a leval winding sheave with an expensive monitoring device. This was way over the top in terms of what this Program would support. Instead, the Program will fund the purchase of two overboarding sheaves but has counseled the group to consult with other operators, i.e. WHOI, who is located down the street, and purchase sheaves with load pins which could provide the digital output and load information they need.

User interfaces that adapt themselves to available user information (such as special needs or individual preferences) are becoming increasingly important, so much so that adaptability has become a selling point for software products. A system with the ability to construct and consult a user model (an explicit representation of properties of a particular user or group of users) can adapt diverse aspects of its performance and enhance its effectiveness, usability and/or acceptance in a variety of situations (e.g., to reduce information overload, to improve the quality of information retrieval, filtering and annotation, and to generate useful information visualizations). Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies. Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems. The annual UMAP conference is the premier forum at which academic and industrial researchers from all these fields gather to present their latest research and to exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues. To encourage student participation, UMAP has established two annual awards valued at $1,000 each endowed by the family of the late James Chen, an active User Modeling researcher, for best student papers (papers that represent primarily student research work and where students are lead authors). More information about the conference is available online at http://www.um.org/umap2017/. <br/><br/>Attending and presenting their work at UMAP will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization researchers. First, they will have the opportunity to present their work to a knowledgeable audience and through lively discussions get useful comments at an early stage of their research when it will be most useful. Just as importantly, they will have a chance to meet established researchers and other graduate students doing similar work, to exchange ideas and to make contacts that will be invaluable to them as they progress in their scientific careers. Interacting with young researchers is also beneficial to experienced investigators, by providing fresh ideas and new perspectives. Thus, the Doctoral Consortium is a great confidence builder for the students involved, and highly stimulating to the senior researchers as well. Many past participants in the UMAP Doctoral Consortium have gone on to become well-regarded researchers and practitioners in the field. Students whose work has been selected for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium will benefit from that experience in a number of additional ways. They will be invited to write a paper that will be published in the UMAP 2017 conference proceedings, which will be included in the ACM Digital Library. And they will have a 30-minute window in which to present their work (with a short demonstration where appropriate), including time for questions and discussion. During the question/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, organizing committee members and other participants will provide constructive comments on each student's work and attempt to address aspects on which the student has requested advice. The organizers have reaffirmed the long-standing and demonstrated UMAP commitment to diversity; to this end, they will make special efforts to recruit women and members of under-represented groups when selecting the candidates to receive financial support.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1738024","David","Chin","chin@hawaii.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Hawaii","HONOLULU","968222234","8089567800","2440 Campus Road, Box 368","United States","Hawaii","HI","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They live in the sewers, wash windshields at busy intersections, or solicit money from metro riders. Their numbers are difficult to enumerate, but scholars have estimated that there are between 14,000 and 20,000 youth living and working on the streets of Mexico City. A serious problem in Mexico City, homeless youth are part of a larger, global phenomenon. UNICEF has estimated there are as many as 150 million children and adolescents living on the streets worldwide?the majority in megacities of the developing world. This project is one of the first in-depth studies of the social lives of homeless youth. The findings have the potential to inform policy and aid provision for homeless and at risk youth that live in cities across the developing world. <br/><br/>Street youth are a ubiquitous feature of cities in the developing world. These cities are characterized by widespread informality as the majority of households have at least one member working in unregulated income-generating activities and many live in informal or self-help housing. Scholars have examined various aspects of informality in these cities but have largely overlooked the millions of street youth who are a unique component of informality in these cities. An understanding of these settings is incomplete without an investigation of the social worlds of such youth.

For example, visitors flock to New England to enjoy fall leaf colors and birdwatchers congregate in May to welcome migrating birds. Seasonal timing also matters to plants and animals. To fuel their fall migrations, birds rely on calorie-rich wild fruits. Likewise, the plants that make those fruits rely on migrating birds to carry their seeds to places where they can grow into new plants. This mutually beneficial interaction works because the timing of wild fruit production matches the timing of bird migration. In many places, however, the seasonal timing of bird migration and fruit production has become misaligned. With not enough fruit to fuel their migratory flights, birds may suffer during migration. And, without birds to disperse their seeds, some plants could fail to produce the next generation. This research will measure how much fruit production and bird migration are misaligned. Investigators will study the environmental cues for fall migration and fruit production as well as the factors that control how many fruits are produced by wild plants. Members of the public will participate by providing observations on bird-fruit interactions and will learn about scientific research through field trips led by the investigators. <br/><br/>The relationships between environmental cues and fall seasonal events in birds and plants remain largely unexplored. This project will use multi-year, multi-species, publicly available datasets to estimate year-to-year differences in the timing of fall migration in birds and fruiting in fleshy-fruited shrubs. Two methods will be employed to determine relationships. First, researchers will use Bayesian survival models to regress data on yearly timing of migration and fruiting from the National Phenology Network and eBird, respectively, with data on environmental drivers. Second, a common garden experiment with five genera of shrubs will be set up to mechanistically determine for the first time how increased temperature, drought, and the interaction between the temperature and drought affect the timing and abundance of fruits. Results will be useful in predicting the ability of birds to migrate and fruiting-plants to disperse their seeds.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701858","Chris","Elphick","chris.elphick@uconn.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Connecticut","Storrs","062691133","8604863622","438 Whitney Road Ext.","United States","Connecticut","CT","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Morgan","Tingley","morgan.tingley@uconn.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Manette","Sandor","manette.sandor@uconn.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research will enhance basic understanding of disability and older adult mental health by moving beyond understanding physical disability as directly linked to poorer mental health to emphasize how and why disability compromises emotional well-being. The findings will have a positive impact through their utility for various stakeholders of older adults' health by: informing intervention strategies of rehabilitation hospitals; helping families provide a supportive environment for recovery that enhances well-being; allowing health insurers to develop early and effective practices that reduce additional mental and physical health declines; and informing architects and designers of the ways in which older adults with physical disabilities encounter the physical environment to optimize implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). <br/><br/><br/>Over a third of older adults in the U.S. are physically disabled. Disablement likely restricts the ability to engage in interpersonal interactions and thus the mental health of older adults with physical disabilities may reflect unmet social needs. Understanding the processes that lead to lower social interaction among those with physical disabilities is important because social isolation is associated with not only poor mental health but also lower self-rated health, greater healthcare use and cost, and even mortality. The main objective of the project is to identify and explore how perceived interpersonal and environmental barriers to social interaction shape mental health among older adults with physical disabilities. To do this, the proposed project will employ a mixed methods design. Analyses of nationally representative survey data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) will be combined with in-depth interviews with older adults with physical disabilities. The survey data will be used to establish the association between physical disability, social interaction, and mental health. However, assessment of perceived barriers to social interaction, given their individualized nature, would be difficult to achieve through the standardized closed-response questionnaire design of large surveys. Consequently, semi-structured interviews with 60 older adults with physical disabilities who are (former) patients at a rehabilitation center in the Midwest will be used to allow for detailed exploration of individuals? perceptions of factors that make social interaction difficult. This project advances and the findings will test an expanded theoretical model that integrates biopsychosocial and stress process theories to identify perceived interpersonal and environmental barriers to social interaction as situationally dependent and thus intermittent stressors that shape the mental health of older adults with physical disabilities","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1702959","David","Warner","dwarner3@unl.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Lincoln","685031435","4024723171","151 Prem S.

Elekonich","A central challenge in the study of behavior is to understand the mechanisms by which genetic changes can cause behaviors to vary. Though nesting is a heritable, tractable behavior with profound consequences for survival and reproduction in rodents, the genes that influence this trait and the precise neural circuitry governing this behavior are unknown. This research project will complement an ongoing genetic study and bridge the gap between our understanding of genetic, neurobiological and behavioral variation by identifying the neurons that are active during nesting and characterizing gene expression patterns in these cells. These are crucial steps in understanding how genetic changes can alter the structure and function of a mammalian nervous system, an area of inquiry with implications beyond nesting behavior. Moreover, this is a unique opportunity to identify a genetic change that contributes to a behavioral difference in naturally evolving populations, examples of which are very rare, especially in mammals. As this genetic variant is segregating in wild rodent populations, the results of these experiments will provide insights into the evolution of mammalian behavior that may be broadly applicable to other species, including humans. Finally, of the researchers will create videos and educational materials including activities, problems sets, and exam questions to complement the videos that will be made freely available to educators and the public through the Hoekstra Laboratory website, the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology Teacher Resource Page, and the National Association for Biology Teachers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two sister species Peromyscus polionotus (the oldfield mouse) and P. maniculatus (the deer mouse) that differ in their latency to build nests of thermoregulatory value to further understand how genetic changes can alter the structure and function of a mammalian nervous system and, ultimately, behaviors important for fitness. Cross-fostering experiments between the two species demonstrated that this difference is heritable, and a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping experiment identified 3 genomic regions that contribute to interspecific variation, including one locus containing only 62 candidate genes. This research will significantly extend and improve upon this existing body of work. First, the researchers will use Immediate-Early Gene (IEG) expression patterns to identify the cell populations in the brain active during nesting, which will itself be a novel finding and will additionally allow subsequent experiments to focus on the brain regions and cells most relevant for the behavioral difference. Following this the researchers will characterize the transcriptomes of those neurons specifically active during nesting using a cutting-edge phosphorylated ribosome profiling technique. Together, these aims will both narrow the list of candidate genes generated by the genetic mapping approach and provide insights into how those genetic changes modify neural circuits to produce behavioral differences. The researchers will also make short educational videos tailored to a high school/undergraduate audience using VideoScribe (http://www.videoscribe.co/) to explain basic concepts in genetics and neuroscience and their application to the study of behavioral evolution.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701805","Hopi","Hoekstra","hoekstra@oeb.harvard.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Harvard University","Cambridge","021385366","6174955501","1033 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Caitlin","Lewarch","clewarch@fas.harvard.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Polymer-NC composites are employed as optically-active elements in a wide range of applications, such as downshifting layers for lighting and displays, as scintillation detectors, hybrid organic/inorganic light-emitting diodes, and luminescent solar concentrators. These and related applications often require a higher volumetric density of NCs, along with better nanoparticle dispersion, than is currently achievable, in order to minimize aggregation-induced optical losses from light scattering and interparticle energy- and charge-transfer. Purely random dispersions fail to minimize optical losses from several important mechanisms characterized by a non-linear dependence on particle spacing, including elastic light-scattering, and quenching caused by near-field interparticle energy- and charge-transfer, because these processes are dominated not by the mean interparticle separation, but instead by fluctuations around the mean. The development of high performance polymer-NC composites for the most demanding optical applications necessitates a careful balance of order and disorder, managed over nanometer- to micron-length scales, requiring more careful design and control over interparticle spacing statistics than has generally been recognized or pursued. This research is integrating theory, synthesis, and materials characterization, in order to identify, measure, and control the key statistical properties of luminescent NC spatial distributions which govern non-linear distance-dependent loss mechanisms.

Non-native plants may become invasive when they escape their natural enemies that control their growth in their native range, which is called the enemy release hypothesis. These natural enemies of plants occur both above- and belowground, though belowground enemies have generally been less well studied. Plant-parasitic nematodes live in soil, feed on plant roots, and can control the growth of native plants. However, little is known about feeding preferences of nematodes, and whether invasive plants escape damage due to these preferences. Additionally, plant-parasitic nematodes have a variety of different feeding strategies. Some have a general strategy of feeding on the root surface, while others have a more specialized approach of burrowing into the root tissue to feed inside the root. Differences in these feeding strategies may affect the strength of enemy release that invasive plants experience when they invade into new areas. This research will provide insights into invasive plants and their escape from natural enemies while providing valuable research opportunities to undergraduate students in an EPSCoR state. Because this work focuses on an invasive grass in the Great Lakes sand dunes, this work will contribute to a better understanding of Great Lakes coastal ecology and management.<br/><br/> This project seeks to understand two factors related to enemy release - feeding preferences of plant-parasitic nematodes and plant growth responses to release from generalist and specialized enemies. Using invasion by Leymus arenarius (sand ryegrass) into Ammophila breviligulata (American beachgrass) dominated sand dunes as a model system, this research will address two basic questions: Do plant-parasitic nematodes exhibit feeding preferences for native plants over non-native plants? Do non-native plants experience greater release from specialist herbivores over generalist herbivores? These questions will be answered using a series of lab and greenhouse experiments. These results will reveal whether nematodes can detect plant roots, exhibit preferences for certain plants, and whether these preferences vary with feeding specialization. In a companion greenhouse experiment, plant responses to nematode feeding specialization and density will be assessed. Results from this work will broaden the understanding of the role belowground herbivores play in enemy release during non-native plant invasion.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701084","Sarah","Emery","sarah.emery@louisville.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Louisville Research Foundation Inc","Louisville","402021959","5028523788","The Nucleus","United States","Kentucky","KY","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matthew","Reid","matthew.reid.1@louisville.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This pattern is often explained in terms of temperature, climate, or geological conditions. Less frequently, the latitudinal gradient is described in terms of biotic interactions; interactions between different organisms. This research investigates a particular biotic interaction, the lichen symbiosis, along a large environmental gradient from North to South America. Lichens are symbioses (mutually beneficial, long-term, close physical associations) between fungi and algae/cyanobacteria. Though small and often overlooked, lichens can be found in almost every terrestrial environment, making them ideal for investigating biotic interactions across large environmental gradients. This research will focus on the role of symbiosis in driving patterns of diversity, and may improve predictions of how patterns of diversity change in the face of ongoing changes in climate. This research uniquely addresses both partners in the symbiosis, and will increase our knowledge of global biodiversity through the discovery and description of new species and traits. This project will extend the research and training of a doctoral student by supporting research that moves from descriptive pattern to mechanistic process. A workshop on symbioses will be made available to undergraduate students in Michigan, and educational materials for high school classrooms will be offered via the Data Nugget program, promoting the scientific process and potentially recruiting more students to science and technology at the college level. <br/><br/>The biotic interactions hypothesis proposes that in extra-tropical regions, abiotic selective pressures exert a stronger force, whereas in tropical regions, biotic selective pressures exert a stronger force. Furthermore, these biotic interactions lead to moving peaks of adaptation, and coevolutionary races, which further contributes to diversification in the tropics. This research investigates the dynamics of the lichen symbiosis along a latitudinal gradient by sequencing both the fungal and algal partners within five lichen-forming families of fungi found along the latitudinal gradient in order to map patterns of specificity among partners, and to test whether partner switches have resulted in diversification events or range shifts in the lichen symbiosis.","03/30/2017","03/30/2017","1701736","Larry","Prather","alan@msu.edu","03/30/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Klara","Scharnagl","scharnag@msu.edu","03/30/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These mats develop a structure similar to soil through the accumulation of living and dead plants in the canopy. Whether these roots take up significant water and nutrients, however, has not been measured or even confirmed. The nutrient and water resources that are potentially transferred by the roots may offer a considerable benefit to the health and growth of trees. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to examine the exchange of water and nutrients between epiphytic mats and host trees that grow roots underneath the canopy soil. Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are likely to continue to rise, and drought to become more severe. Canopy roots and epiphytes may be crucial to maintaining plant biodiversity in critical habitats, and convey an advantage, especially under conditions where trees become heat-stressed. Results from this project will significantly improve the effectiveness of ecological restoration plans. In addition, students including those from underrepresented groups will be involved in this project, gaining valuable experience in scientific research. <br/><br/>This project will assess canopy root activity, canopy water redistribution and physiological and ecological roles of adventitious roots. Three approaches will be used to accomplish these objectives: lab, greenhouse and field experiments. (Need to mention the lab experiments) Greenhouse trials are designed to simulate plant water relations (in a simplified system) between epiphytes and host trees via canopy roots using poplar trees (Populus trichocarpa). Preliminary data show that there is water uptake by canopy roots in this poplar system, and suggest potential bi-directional water flow (i.e. up- and downwards sap flow) within the tree. Data also suggest that trees with canopy roots can mitigate drought conditions by taking up water from epiphyte mats. Similar procedures will be applied to confirm that these activities also occur under field conditions in Olympic National Park, WA. There the focus will be on bigleaf maple trees (Acer macrophyllum), which develop canopy roots naturally. Stable isotopes will be used to track water transport from canopy roots to other parts of the tree during different seasons, and to understand the physiological and ecological role of adventitious roots under adverse conditions of water availability.","03/31/2017","03/31/2017","1700838","Elizabeth","Van Volkenburgh","lizvanv@u.washington.edu","03/31/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Soo-Hyung","Kim","soohkim@u.washington.edu","03/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Johanna","Cantillo Polo","jjcp87@uw.edu","03/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On October 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew had a final landfall at Winyah Bay, South Carolina, and resulted in torrential rain and extensive flooding in a short period of time. This extreme weather event flooded an extensive area of the coastal plain, inundating the coastal wetland for a prolonged period that could potentially have stimulated many oxygen-deficient processes including microbial mercury methylation. This research will investigate if and how microbial mercury methylation is stimulated during the prolonged flooding period in these coastal wetlands. This study represents a new and unique collaboration between four investigators with different specialties from three institutions including two assistant professors from a minority serving institution and an undergraduate institution, respectively. This study will also raise the awareness of the impacts of extreme weather events on toxic mercury cycling in low-lying coastal areas in the southeastern United States.<br/><br/>This RAPID research is aimed at examining the influences of Hurricane Matthew on the dynamics of microbial mercury methylation in coastal forested wetlands near Winyah Bay, South Carolina, where Hurricane Matthew had a final landfall. Specifically, this study will integrate field sampling and laboratory experiments to investigate the impacts of this extreme weather event on microbial methylation of mercury in the coastal wetland soils over the course of variation in flooding levels. To evaluate the immediate impacts of Hurricane Matthew on mercury cycling, surface water and wetland soil samples have been collected by the research team since October 10, 2016 near Winyah Bay, South Carolina, where Hurricane Matthew had a final landfall on October 8, 2016. The sampling sites represent transects along with different degrees of seawater intrusion and flood severity impacted by Hurricane Matthew. Samples will be quantified for total mercury and methylmercury, and the abundance of mercury methylation genes (hgcA) associated with the wetland surface soils over time, to examine the temporal and spatial variations of mercury methylation and abundance of mercury methylation genes. Results will be used to evaluate the formation of hot spots and hot moments of mercury methylation in these wetland soils under prolonged inundation. Moreover, controlled laboratory experiments will be employed to examine the effects of different environmental factors on microbial methylation of mercury in these wetland soils, including duration of inundation, addition of fresh litter, increase of water salinity, and a combination of these factors. The proposed work will provide a better understanding of how microbial mercury methylation, the key biogeochemical step making mercury toxic, is impacted in coastal wetlands by extreme weather events.","03/31/2017","03/31/2017","1711642","Parke","Rublee","rublee@uncg.edu","03/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of North Carolina Greensboro","GREENSBORO","274125013","3363345878","1111 Spring Garden Street","United States","North Carolina","NC","7295","GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martin","Tsui","tmtsui@uncg.edu","03/31/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alex","Chow","achow@clemson.edu","03/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Shaowu","Bao","sbao@coastal.edu","03/31/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences. VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2017. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community. Special efforts have been made by the organizers to achieve diversity among the students across institutions, and to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities. <br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the previous such events, which were also supported by NSF. The main activities of the DC will take place on Saturday, March 18, in parallel with the first day of IEEE 3DUI. The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results. A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years. The VR conference will begin the evening of Sunday, March 19, with a welcome reception, where DC participants will network with what they have learned during the full day event. The DC attendees will also participate in a poster session, which will give them more opportunities to network and discuss their research. Additional smaller activities, including a lunch with key leaders in the 3DUI and VR research communities, will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week; in particular, small groups of 2-3 students will meet for mentoring lunches and/or other networking events with senior members of the VR/3DUI community. The IEEE VR/3DUI conference planners will generously provide as much financial support as possible to the DC through the main conference's budget, including meeting space, audio-visual rental, and food and beverage during breaks for free. In addition, the IEEE VR/3DUI conference will pay for a welcoming dinner and the working lunch for the students and mentoring committee, which will provide critical opportunities for students to learn from mentors and VIP leaders in the field.","03/31/2017","03/31/2017","1736043","Toni","Pence","pencet@uncw.edu","03/31/2017","Principal Investigator","University of North Carolina at Wilmington","Wilmington","284033201","9109623167","601 South College Road","United States","North Carolina","NC","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","1640","INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7367",NA,NA,NA,"Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kimbrel","This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in Computer Science (USICCS) program. Through this program, NSF and the United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based researchers.<br/><br/>Many important problems in the modern world can be solved by finding shortest paths in some network. Some examples include computing driving directions from one city to another in a road network, or routing internet traffic from one computer to another in a communication network such as the internet. The networks in such applications are not only complex, but can also be extremely large. The development of fast, reliable and scalable algorithms for shortest paths is thus of crucial importance. The major goal of the proposed research is to provide such algorithms in a variety of settings, providing mathematical guarantees on their performance and scalability.<br/><br/>The research will focus on two notions of data structures maintaining shortest paths, both focusing on storing distance information using small space. The first are Distance oracles (DOs), data structures that compactly represent the path structure of a network with the ability to quickly retrieve approximate distances and shortest paths between any two given nodes. The research aims at deepening our understanding of DOs in several different ways: by obtaining DOs with improved guarantees in new (e.g. distributed) settings, by developing faster algorithms for constructing DOs, and by proving conditional, or preferably unconditional cell-probe lower bounds showing that the obtained guarantees are essentially optimal. The second type of shortest paths data structures that will be considered are Distance sensitivity oracles (DSOs). These are data structures that provide a compact representation of the distances in a graph in which edges can become unavailable. A query to a DSO consists of a failed edge and two nodes, a source and a target, and the DSO must return a shortest path from the source to the target that does not use the failed edge. The goal here is to develop faster algorithms for constructing DSOs with fast query times, and to prove relationships between DSOs and other closely related problems such as all-pairs shortest paths. In addition to their intrinsic value, DSOs may also help develop efficient dynamic shortest paths algorithms which is another objective of this project.<br/><br/>Besides the clear practical motivation behind the project, the problems to be studied have intriguing relations to many concepts in mathematics (metric embeddings, graph and geometric spanners, etc). Thus the impact of this research goes beyond the strict boundaries of computer science. The PI is whole-heartedly committed to diversity.

These ants use plant leaf cuttings in order to cultivate a single, recently evolved fungal species, which they then eat. However, a more poorly known group of fungus-farming ants in the genus Apterostigma, cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants combined. Closely related species of Apterostigma cultivate closely related groups of fungi, but major shifts to distantly related fungal groups have occurred multiple times during 40 million years of co-evolution between Apterostigma ants and fungus. This research aims to better understand the co-evolution of leaf-cutting ants and the fungi they cultivate. This includes developing new knowledge about the numbers, diversity and distribution of Apterostigma ant species and their associated fungi, as well as determining the evolutionary relationships among both ants and fungi. Questions to be addressed include: Why do leaf-cutting ants in the genus Apterostigma cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants (leaf-cutting and non-leaf-cutting) combined? Why do some Apterostigma ant species cultivate only a few fungi that are closely related to each other, while others cultivate diverse fungi that are only distant relatives? The results from this research may benefit society in general because fungus-farming ants provide a rare non-human model system for the emerging fields of Darwinian agriculture and Darwinian medicine, which aim to improve human agriculture and disease management through the study of analogous natural systems. Recently several antibiotics and antimalarial quinones have been isolated and described from fungi and bacterial species living in association with leaf-cutting ants, making their biology particularly relevant to issues of health. Further, some fungi associated with leaf-cutting ants have become models for more efficient biofuel production.<br/><br/>This research will proceed by comprehensive field collecting of ants and fungi from nests throughout their distributions in nature, and documenting the presence or absence of co-speciation patterns in Apterostigma ants and their fungal cultivars, by comparing phylogenetic analyses based on genomic data for both ants and fungi. The researchers will employ targeted enrichment of Ultra-Conserved genetic Elements (UCEs) to infer the species-level phylogenies. These phylogenies will be used in testing hypotheses of co-evolution and fungal species fidelity and mobility among host ant species over time. The genomic UCE data will also be used to resolve species boundaries (identify species) among poorly known species-complexes of Apterostigma ants. This is essential for reconstructing species-specific ant-fungus co-evolutionary interactions as well as for revising ant taxonomy and producing pictorial identification keys to various ant species.","03/31/2017","03/31/2017","1740940","Christian","Rabeling","crabeling@gmail.com","03/31/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS","9169","BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS","EGCH","ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) organization mobilized a U.S. reconnaissance team to explore the affected area immediately following the KES. The U.S. team in collaboration with Japanese investigators identified significant case histories that warrant further investigation due to their unique, unanticipated, and poorly understood nature, as well as their important potential implications for seismic design and safety in the U.S. and around the world. These case histories include, among other things: an unexplained 10km-long depression zone within the Mount Aso volcano caldera that caused significant damage to structures and transmission lines; a fault rupture through the spillway of a large dam impounding a full reservoir; and surprisingly limited observations of soil liquefaction and its effects for an earthquake of this size and apparent site conditions. This RAPID award supports a detailed study of the underlying causes behind these observations through: (1) the use of state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques to collect perishable surface topology, soil deformation, and structure settlement or tilt information from known liquefaction and major landslide sites; (2) the collection of preliminary geotechnical, seismic, geologic, and topographic information from potential case history sites of interest; and (3) the performance of a comprehensive set of laboratory tests on retrieved samples followed by preliminary simulations to evaluate the soil's resistance to liquefaction and response under cyclic loading. In doing so, this award contributes to the state of knowledge and practice in critical areas of geotechnical earthquake engineering and hence, the resilience of geotechnical structures and infrastructure globally.

This project at North Carolina Central State University will investigate mathematical modeling with probability distributions and will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their statistical knowledge through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Georgetown University.<br/><br/>Count data arise in a variety of situations and are often modeled with a Poisson distribution. In many cases, however, the data do not satisfy the Poisson distribution's property of equal mean and variance. This project will examine the two-parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution that accounts for over-dispersion where the variance is greater than the mean and under-dispersion where the variance is less than the mean. The CMP distribution captures the Poisson, Bernoulli, and geometric distributions as special cases. The first goal of this project is to conduct a simulation study which compares properties of the CMP distribution to those of mixed Poisson probability distributions, such as the Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-Lindley and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, that have traditionally been used to model over-dispersed data. The second goal is to derive and develop inferential methods for a bivariate CMP distribution. To demonstrate the flexibility of the CMP distribution and its extensions, applications to real-world data will be considered.

Specifically, it examines the development of the cultural stereotype that links males but not females with intellectual brilliance and genius. Previous research has found that academic disciplines that are believed to require a ""spark of genius"" tend to have the largest gender gaps. Because many science fields are portrayed in such terms, the ""brilliance = males"" stereotype may be an important factor in explaining the persistent gender gap in these disciplines. The primary goal of this research is understanding how this stereotype is acquired over the course of development. Investigating the development of this stereotype will inform how the stereotype might steer capable young women away from pursuing careers in science and technology and may also inform the optimal timing of potential interventions to block its adverse effects. <br/><br/>This project consists of three studies to examine three crucial developmental issues. First, it investigates the development of children's knowledge of the cultural stereotype that males are more likely to be brilliant than females. Second, it investigates the development of gender differences in children's motivation to engage in activities portrayed as requiring high levels of intellectual aptitude. Finally, it investigates longitudinally whether internalizing the stereotype against females' intellectual abilities undermines young girls' subsequent motivation to engage in activities that are said to require brilliance and giftedness. This research explores the development of a set of processes that ultimately limit opportunities for women. As such, these studies will improve parents', educators', and policy-makers' ability to intervene at the root of the problem to promote greater gender equity in those domains of academia and industry in which women have traditionally been underrepresented.<br/><br/>This proposal is being co-funded by Developmental and Learning Sciences, Social Psychology, and Science of Broadening Participation within the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and by the Education and Human Resources Directorate's Core Research program and the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering program.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1733897","Andrei","Cimpian","acimpian@illinois.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","New York University","NEW YORK","100121019","2129982121","70 WASHINGTON SQUARE S","United States","New York","NY","1332","SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","1698","DEVELOP& LEARNING SCIENCES/CRI","8050","Science of Broadening Participation","1332","SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","8212","Broaden Particip STEM Resrch",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1544","1698",NA,NA,"RES ON GENDER IN SCI & ENGINE","DS - Developmental Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Schmid","The goal of this research is to renovate the support structure designs for part overhang geometries in powder-bed Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM). It is hypothesized that the poor thermal conductivity of sintered powders is the root cause of part defects such as warping associated with part overhang (or similar) geometries. Hence, the required function of support structures is not from the weight-carrying standpoint; rather, the complex thermal and mechanical phenomena of the EBAM process, which lead to residual stresses and distortions, should be studied for functional support designs. Specifically, this research will characterize sintered powder porosity and its effects on thermal properties, develop finite element thermomechanical simulations incorporating porosity-dependent thermal properties for temperature and stress predictions in EBAM, evaluate overhang geometry effects on the part thermomechanical behaviors in EBAM and correlate with warping severity, and investigate different support patterns to evaluate the effectiveness of a designed support.<br/><br/>The outcome of this research will enhance the performance and efficient usage of the EBAM technology through improved and effective support structures. Thus, the project will directly benefit the users of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, strengthening the global competitiveness of the nation's industry. Collaborating with one of primary EBAM users, Marshall Space Flight Center, the research team may further apply findings to tackle pragmatic problems that exist in AM technologies. Moreover, new process understanding from this research will benefit studies on other powder-based AM processes such as selective laser sintering. In addition, working with the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, the research team will disseminate the project results timely and widely to the AM industry. Further societal impacts of this research include reviving high school students' interest in engineering and technology, particularly, from underrepresented groups.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1739435","Kevin","Chou","kevin.chou@louisville.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Louisville Research Foundation Inc","Louisville","402021959","5028523788","The Nucleus","United States","Kentucky","KY","1468","Manufacturing Machines & Equip","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kramer","It is now conceivable to fabricate engineered tissues inside the human body through a ""keyhole"" surgery with a robotic, endoscopic 3D printer. This long-term vision has broad implications for healthcare; the way in which surgeons replace diseased and damaged tissue could be forever transformed. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a study on the dynamics of material delivery in an endoscopic 3D printer, a necessary step to realize this vision. This award also supports an innovative program for high school students to design an assistive device for patients with a specific ambulation disability. <br/><br/>An endoscopic 3D printer is composed of a rod-like end-effector (to deliver a fluid-phase material through a ""keyhole"" surgical site) and a chain of kinematic elements (to position this end-effector). With this form-factor, an endoscopic 3D printer will have dynamic coupling between the positioning and material delivery sub-systems of the end-effector (not observed in a standard 3D printer), and a higher fluidic resistance in the material delivery sub-system than a standard 3D printer. The first research objective is to establish the analytic input-output relationship for the end-effector and compare the output value to a computational model. To achieve this objective, the established Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model for non-Newtonian colloidal fluids will be used to describe the material while geometric constraints and boundary conditions relevant to an endoscopic 3D printer end-effector will be imposed. The output (flowrate) prediction from the input-output relationship will be compared to the predicted output value from a multi-physics computational model. The second objective is to test the hypothesis that the output rise time of a two-degree-of-freedom material delivery actuator (designed to mitigate the higher fluidic resistance) will be significantly lower than the output rise time of a nominal material delivery actuator. This hypothesis will be tested by experiments. The output rise time for the two different material delivery actuators will be measured by machine vision under dynamic flowrate references. The third objective is to establish the input-output relationships of the complete endoscopic 3D printer and compare outputs values to an experiment. To achieve this objective, a quasi-static kinematic model will be used to describe the serial chain of kinematic elements, which will then be coupled with the end-effector input-output relationship established in objectives one and two. Multiple output predictions (six positions and one flowrate) from the input-output relationships will be compared to measured values from experiments performed on a prototype endoscopic 3D printer.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1708819","David","Hoelzle","hoelzle.1@osu.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Ohio State University","Columbus","432101016","6146888735","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Ohio","OH","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV","082E","MFG MACHINES & METROLOGY","083E","MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION PROC","1045","CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1468",NA,NA,NA,"Manufacturing Machines & Equip",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Warr","Determining in vivo protein complex stoichiometry from superresolution microscopy.<br/><br/>Proteins form one of the basic building blocks of life. In living cells, proteins typically assemble into macromolecular complexes in order to perform targeted tasks. Knowing the location and exact composition of protein assemblies enables investigators to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity during key cellular events such as division or movement. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the composition of such complexes in living cells, and it is clear that composition can vary depending on the cellular environment. This project will develop an optical/computational method to count subunits in protein assemblies in living cells, and enable exceptionally detailed information to be gathered about biological processes in native, non-invasive environments. This project combines expertise from the biological, mathematical, and physical sciences and as such provides exceptional interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and postdocs. Moreover, the project will yield methods that will have broad applicability in the optical biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project will extract protein complex stoichiometry directly from the superresolution microscopy technique called PALM (PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy). PALM works by genetically encoding proteins of interest with photoswitchable fluorescing protein (FP) tags. Under sufficiently low light, each FP photoactivates and subsequently photobleaches. Thus, the number of fluorescence spikes over one small region of space should coincide with the number of protein subunits confined to that region (and normally confined to a specific protein complex). In practice, FPs fluoresce on and off (i.e. they 'blink') with blinking properties dependent on the local cellular environment. This blinking has been a major challenge in using PALM as a quantitative tool. The project will adapt the mathematical and statistical inference tools used in the analysis of ion channel patch clamp experiments to determine protein complex stoichiometry directly from PALM data (Goal 1). To determine the complex stoichiometry more accurately, the FP's blinking properties will be simultaneously extracted while determining the complex stoichiometry (Goal 2). The method will be tested on synthetic as well as real data sets where the protein complex stoichiometry is already known. The analysis will then be extended to protein complexes where the stoichiometry is still under current investigation (SpoIIIE and the kinetochore). If successful, this counting method will have several decisive advantages over existing counting methods, which assume specific FP photophysical properties or do not treat FP properties stochastically.<br/><br/><br/>This grant is funded jointly by the Cellular Dynamics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1740965","Steve","Presse","spresse@iupui.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","1114","Cellular Dynamics and Function","1114","CELLULAR SYSTEMS","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7246",NA,NA,NA,"PHYSICS OF LIVING SYSTEMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

IoT is also expected to have many trillion dollars economic impact in the next decade. IoT is a network of physical objects, whose connectivity requires low power consumption, long battery life, low duty cycle and massive number of low cost devices. Based on the recently standardized Narrowband IoT (NB-IOT) technique for machine type communications, the proposed scheme targets adding low cost Ambient Re-Scatter (ARS) devices to an existing NB-IOT communication system, which can significantly improve the overall system capacity and the excess capacity can be shared between the NB-IOT and ARS systems. Hence, this project enables to integrate ultra-low power devices to the communication systems in spectral and energy efficient manners. Novel methods and transmission schemes allowing ARS devices to collaborate with each other and with other networks are also proposed. The success of this project will boost such ultra-low power IoT solutions. The transformative and interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research work will advance the knowledge of communications engineering, and the outcomes of the project can potentially be used by industry for network development and impact future industrial standardizations. This project will also strengthen collaboration in the research field of wireless communications between the United States and Finland.<br/><br/>This project targets enhancing IoT applications through constructing new efficient and secure IoT connectivity solutions by combining emerging machine type communication system with ultra-low power ARS devices via four synergistic thrusts: (1) communication system design and fundamental performance analysis, which will develop robust non-coherent methods that allow the network to communicate with ARS while transmitting data, develop signal processing methods for joint reception of network and ARS data at the receiver, and conduct exhaustive ray-tracing based simulations of the channel with ARS nodes and apply the results to identify feasible operation point for the system; (2) novel radio resource management schemes that exploit matching theory to develop high performance, low complexity, decentralized, and practical solutions in proposed NB-IoT with ARS; (3) security mechanisms for IoT deployment, which will cover both physical layer security in MIMO backscatter and low cost cyber security, considering the physical and low cost natures of the proposed system; (4) system and protocol development, which will demonstrate the applicability of the system design by building a test-bed that integrates the NB-IoT version of the LTE with ARS.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1702850","Zhu","Han","zhan2@uh.edu","04/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Houston","Houston","772042015","7137435773","4800 Calhoun Boulevard","United States","Texas","TX","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","8229","WiFiUS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Miao","Pan","mpan2@central.uh.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a field, comparative immunology is undergoing a transformation propelled by the emergence of new and innovative genomic technologies and the recognition of a wider biological role for immunity. The study of organisms from the very simple (sponges) to the most complex (higher plants and animals) provides unique insight into immunobiology, medicine and evolution. NACI 2017 is designed to bring together established and early career investigators who study immune function in a diverse range of animal species to discuss current research, assess the future directions of the comparative immunology community and develop a plan for meeting these needs. This workshop is expected to result in increased understanding of comparative immunology, which in turn will lead to novel disease prevention and treatment strategies. The majority of the requested funds will be used to provide trainee stipend awards to twenty trainees, which will allow these trainees to participate in the NACI 2017 workshop. Efforts will be made to recruit participants from under-represented groups. The results discussed at the workshop will be disseminated by a publication summarizing the meeting, and on a freely accessible internet site.<br/><br/>The North American Comparative Immunology Workshop (NACI 2017) will bring together comparative immunologists from across the continent. Collectively, these research groups study species from sponges to mammals from a variety of angles; including pathology, development, evolution, and ecology. Although the studied species may be diverse, current research strategies rely on similar omics-based strategies to identify immune-related sequences in each species. Genomic studies demonstrate that even closely related species can possess numerous divergent immune genes and that genes once thought to be indispensable for immune function in one lineage have been lost in others. It is also becoming clear that orthologous immune genes, once thought to play the same role in all species, may in fact, play different roles in different species. These findings are germane not only to our understanding of the natural history of immunity and vaccine development in aqua- and agri-culturally important species but also to the development of human immunotherapeutic monoclonals (the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry). Thus, there is an imminent need to develop assays to study immune gene function in a wide range of species. Despite the recent development of efficient and broadly applicable genome engineering techniques, technological hurdles remain for non-model species, such as the lack of reference genomes, lack of inbred or clonal lines, long generation times and failure to reproduce in captivity. NACI 2017 will provide a venue for the whole field to discuss these hurdles extensively, as a community, and develop a vision for moving Comparative Immunology forward.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1725127","Jeffrey","Yoder","Jeff_Yoder@ncsu.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","7656","SYMBIOSIS DEF & SELF RECOG","1228","MINORITY INVOLVEMENT -- BIO","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ubiquitous computing nature of IoT enables continuous monitoring and management of all healthcare vitals. However, these real-time mission-critical IoT applications demand both a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE), as well as personalization for individual health care contexts. Additionally, there is a need for long-lasting battery-powered wireless sensors, reliable network connectivity, and cloud services. This project aims to solve these challenges via personalization and holistic coupling of the IoT infrastructure and the services provided to end users. The approach utilizes a novel self-aware cognitive architecture that delivers efficient and customized services by learning from end user behavior and adapting the IoT infrastructure to a person's current state, daily life routine, and environment. The project's exemplar application - efficient early detection of life-threatening signs - can potentially save lives through better quality of care, and timely delivery of critical/urgent health indicators. While the project will be validated in the healthcare domain, the project's framework and services are applicable to a broad range of other IoT application domains. The international collaborative nature of this project will enrich the learning experience of students and researchers by exposing them to the challenges of developing IoT services for delivering life-critical services in the healthcare domain.<br/><br/>Quality of Experience (QoE) is a key metric for successful delivery of end-user services for IoT-enabled applications. Achieving consistent end-user QoE poses tremendous challenges in the face of resource constraints and dynamic variations at multiple scales of the IoT system stack: at the application, network, resource, and device levels. Personalization - through holistic coupling of both the IoT infrastructure, as well as end-user services - provides a key opportunity to manage and exploit these variations and deliver customized QoE under resource constraints. This proposal outlines a self-aware Internet of Cognitive Things (IoCT) architecture that leverages edge (i.e., Fog) computing architectures to introduce intelligence and adaptability in integrated multi-scale IoT systems. The objective is to efficiently manage information acquisition, communication and processing across different scales of the IoT systems, while synergistically coupling learning of end-user behaviors to deliver efficient and customized services. The compelling use case of personalized healthcare will be used as an exemplar for a large class of IoT-enabled applications that can exploit and benefit from personalization empowered by a multi-layered, self-aware IoCT architecture.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1702950","Nikil","Dutt","dutt@uci.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","8229","WiFiUS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marco","Levorato","levorato@uci.edu","04/03/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

IoT systems will sense, communicate, and process data to produce reliable decisions and inferences. The investigators study three ways in which each IoT device will be limited: limited ""field of view"" of each sensor; severe energy limitations; unreliability of sensing and communication. This research contributes towards progress of science by obtaining and analyzing novel cross-layer IoT sensing, communication, and computing strategies that outperform classical strategies by several orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and reliability. For validation, the researchers examine improvements on practically relevant problems of health monitoring through neuro-interfaces and distributed camera inference. The research involves several graduate and undergraduate courses, with emphasis on engaging female and minority students.<br/><br/>Severe energy constraints provide a compelling incentive for cross-layer designs of ""cognitive"" IoT systems to jointly sense, compress, communicate, and compute. However, naive cross-layer designs can reduce tolerance to system faults, e.g., sensing/ communication/computation errors. The investigators pursue a systematic understanding, utilizing it to obtain novel cross-layer designs of cognitive IoT strategies that gracefully trade off fault tolerance and efficiency through novel error-correction techniques compatible with limited fields of view. They benchmark this trade off against novel information-theoretic fundamental limits. The obtained techniques increase the robustness of algorithms that use, as a first step, linear projections on distributedly-sensed large dimensional data. Focusing on algorithms for the widely applicable k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) problem, the researchers obtain improved algorithms and analyze performance-efficiency-robustness tradeoffs, bridging information theory, statistics, and machine learning.","04/03/2017","04/03/2017","1702694","Pulkit","Grover","pgrover@andrew.cmu.edu","04/03/2017","Principal Investigator","Carnegie-Mellon University","PITTSBURGH","152133815","4122689527","5000 Forbes Avenue","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1714","SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE","7363","RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS","8229","WiFiUS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2878",NA,NA,NA,"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With more than 6 million dental implants placed per year in the US there is growing need for improved treatment planning processes. This need is enhanced by the increased adoption of dental implants as a procedure performed by general dentists who had traditionally referred such cases to specialists. Inadequate treatment planning is recognized as the single biggest cause of implant failure, which presents an unnecessary health risk for the patient. The adoption of this treatment planning tool will enable greater confidence among both practitioners and patients of dental implant treatments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project develops a novel smart health platform that generates dental implant treatment plan considering the factors required for the successful execution of treatment. The system considers pertinent medical information, information about the tooth intended to be replaced, the available anatomical spaces, the quality of soft tissue of the patient and information about the patient?s oral habits. Research-based algorithms correlate the amount of bone remaining, space available and the type of implant to be used. After assessing the data received, the platform provides an analysis of possible outcomes and, if appropriate, a proposed treatment plan including the type of surgery recommended, the type of implant, and if there is any supplementary surgeries needed to be performed, such as bone or gum grafts. The software will also recommend healing times and post-operative care guidelines for the practitioner that are specifically customized to the patient.

The semiconductor industry provides vital hardware backbone of the information technology age through an extremely wide range of integrated circuits (ICs) in computing devices and consumer electronics. Modern IC development process is bottlenecked by growing chip design complexity, e.g. measured by large device count and functionality diversity, and ever-demanding requirements on computing performance and power/energy efficiency. Advanced IC manufacturing processes are costly, and yet have unavoidable process variations, making fabricated chips susceptible to failures. With its revenue reaching $7.8 billion in 2015, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry supplies indispensable tools and methodologies that make IC design possible. The potential market and societal impact of the proposed EDA innovation is substantial. This technology can help semiconductor and chip design companies develop integrated circuits of improved performance and robustness with a reduced time-to-market and development cost.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project demonstrates novel machine learning algorithms targeting electronic design automation. As the complexity of integrated circuits scales up rapidly, the need for smart design tools is prominent. The EDA industry is in the early phase of rapid integration of machine learning algorithms into commercial IC design flows. The learning methods focused in this project significantly improve the accuracy of statistical regression and classification over the current-state-of-the-art, and offer the much needed understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Built upon the focused machine learning algorithms, the targeted EDA technology can efficiently process simulation or measured performance data of existing chip designs, and intelligently learn the complex hidden relationships between performance specifications, design parameters, and manufacturing conditions. As a result, it offers a powerful data science solution to IC design optimization, verification, and debug.

The project is a result of a confluence of astronomy, aerospace, computational science and artificial intelligence. Commercialization of this technology has the potential to revolutionize space exploration, self-driving cars, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other such systems which need accurate position estimation. A key advantage of this project's technology is enhanced cybersecurity as it does not rely on external signals for navigation. Further, this project will contribute open-source software to the scientific community. It is envisioned that development of a software toolbox that integrates with the popular ROS (Robot Operating System) library will allow researchers to simulate autonomous navigation without GPS.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a result of research into the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In SLAM, a robot is not given prior knowledge of its environment, it must use its sensory data and actions to simultaneously build a map of its environment and position itself within its uncertain map. Competing methods in this area exhibit positioning errors which may be unsuitable for long-term navigation. The work developed here shows that by fusing orientation sensing with short-range sensing, the system attain a simplification of the underlying optimization problem. This allows fast and globally optimal solutions. In this approach, a vehicle uses a camera to track celestial bodies in the sky which allows the vehicle to estimate its orientation in space, this information is fused with short-range sensors such as lasers and cameras which track features in vicinity of the vehicle.

Membranes used in water treatment processes are exposed to feed waters containing organic, inorganic, and biological species, which leads to fouling and loss of membrane productivity over time. Since performance loss due to fouling is one of the largest costs associated with membrane processes in water treatment, discovery of new surface treatments that limit fouling would have significant economic and societal impacts. Fouling propensity of a membrane depends greatly on its surface properties such as chemistry and morphology. The goal of this project is to develop the multiscale mathematical framework to predict fouling behavior on the surfaces of membranes with different geometric patterns and chemical coatings. The ability to predict fouling properties of new membrane surfaces in silico will accelerate the discovery of novel membrane designs and decrease the time from laboratory to market. <br/><br/>In this project, comprehensive studies involving iterative feedback between computational modeling and experimental measurements will be performed to test two main hypotheses: (1) targeted combinations of geometric and chemical patterns on a membrane surface will significantly reduce membrane fouling, and (2) experimentally-trained multiscale computational models will accelerate the discovery of novel geometric and chemical surface modifications that significantly reduce membrane fouling. This research will (i) produce a mathematical framework and corresponding models to identify the physical mechanisms and geometric features controlling mass and momentum transfer through and over micro- and nanopatterned membranes, (ii) provide a deep understanding of how foulants and energy fluxes are controlled and regulated by complex topologies, and (iii) elucidate how the macroscopic behavior of filtration flow rates and reactive transport processes are coupled with phenomena at the micro- and nano-scale. This work will be transformational because delivering an experimentally-validated computational framework will enable rapid screening of many membrane surface modifications to short-list the most promising ones for further testing, and it will lead to a leapfrog improvement in membrane filtration technologies. This project will provide a multidisciplinary environment for training graduate and undergraduate researchers. New communication platforms such as Zoom video conferencing will be used to deliver virtual science demonstrations and laboratory tours to elementary school.","04/04/2017","04/04/2017","1742175","Ilenia","Battiato","ibattiat@stanford.edu","04/04/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","8292","DMREF","8400","DMREF",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, there are no efficient semiconductor lasers operating in the deep visible (green and yellow) spectral range, which has been limited by the presence of large densities of defects in gallium nitride based materials. Consequently, the current commercial green lasers generally rely on the use of nonlinear optical conversion. Such devices, however, are bulky, heavy and expensive, and are not suitable for on-chip integration. Moreover, there has been no established manufacturable technology to spatially vary alloy compositions to achieve multi-color emission on the same substrate. As a result, the current solid-state lamps rely on the use of rare earth doped phosphors to down-convert the blue emission of a gallium nitride based light emitting diode (LED) to generate white-light, which limits the flexibility to tune the spectral power distribution and to achieve color-tunable emission. In this project, by using gallium nitride based nanostructures, the applicant will address these fundamental challenges and demonstrate small size, high efficiency multi-color lasers. This project will address the ""green gap"" in semiconductor light emitters and will enable phosphor-free solid-state lighting, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency, reducing the manufacturing cost, and improving the light quality. The broader impacts of this research also include the highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and the outreach to undergraduate, underrepresented minorities, and K-12. This project also provides the opportunity to educate the students involved in the research and to involve high school students on the science and technology of nanostructured materials, LED lighting, and photonics.<br/><br/>Technical: The applicant proposes to demonstrate white-color and full-color surface-emitting lasers through innovations in epitaxy, quantum-confined nanostructures, nanophotonics, and device engineering. Full-color emission will be achieved on a single chip by varying the nanowire diameters through selective area epitaxy, which was not previously possible for gallium nitride based quantum wells. Moreover, nonradiative surface recombination, one of the primary limiting factors for nanowire devices, will be addressed by using dot-in-nanowire core-shell heterostructures. In this project, surface-emitting lasers will be achieved by exploiting the two-dimensional band-edge resonant effect of a nanowire photonic crystal, instead of using conventional thick and resistive distributed Bragg reflectors. The unique approach will also enable the monolithic integration of red, green and blue emitters on a single chip, thereby leading to full-color and white-color laser diodes that were not previously possible. The device characteristics, including threshold, wall-plug efficiency, near and far-field profile, and modulation characteristics will be investigated.","04/04/2017","04/04/2017","1709207","Zetian","Mi","ztmi@umich.edu","04/04/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","1517","ELECT, PHOTONICS, & MAG DEVICE","091E","Light generation & detection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Holman<br/>Proposal Number: 1509687/ 1509864<br/><br/>The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth. Currently, solar cells based on crystalline silicon materials dominate the photovoltaics market for production of electricity from the sun because they offer the highest solar energy conversion efficiency at the lowest manufacturing cost. However, to accelerate the penetration of solar energy in the renewable electricity market, the solar energy conversion efficiency of silicon-based solar cells must ultimately increase beyond its practical limit of 24%. The goal of this project is develop a silicon-based solar cell which contains Group III and V elements from the Periodic Table, arranged in layers which have the potential to increase the solar energy conversion efficiency to 30%. The fundamental science underlying the performance of this the III-V/silicon tandem cell will be used to develop the best strategy for eventual manufacture. As part of the educational activities of this project, the principal investigators will be actively involved in an outreach program that seeks to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in engineering by using solar research as a platform for involvement in both technical and career-development sessions at Veterans meetings and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers conference.<br/><br/>Photovoltaic devices that contain multiple p-n junctions are currently the only route to achieve solar energy conversion efficiencies that exceed the Shockley-Queisser single p-n junction limit that caps the theoretical performance of crystalline silicon solar cells currently in commercial use. The overall goal of this proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of two-terminal tandem solar cell performance through controlled growth of Group III-V elements on silicon. The fabrication strategy is guided by fundamental studies and is designed to optimize the material and device architecture to achieve 30% solar energy conversion efficiency, which is beyond the 24% practical limit of single-junction crystalline silicon solar cells. Towards this end, the model Group III-V material selected for study is GaAsP, since it has a direct and tunable bandgap, and can be grown on a transparent, compositionally graded buffer on a GaP/Si template. The bottom cell of the tandem device will be based on an amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell, where the front amorphous silicon layers will be replaced with the GaP template layer upon which the top cell is grown. The research plan has three objectives. The first objective is to understand and control the formation of threading dislocations in the GaAsP absorber, and to develop optimized window and back-surface field layers for the top cell that will both increase transmission into the GaAsP absorber and reduce surface recombination. The second objective is to understand and improve the passivation of GaP on silicon and the transport of electrons across the conduction band offset. The third objective is to maximize the conversion of infrared light into current in the bottom cell by designing single-side light-trapping textures and dielectric/metal rear reflectors, and then tune the thicknesses, doping densities, and bandgaps of the III-V supporting layers to both form a recombination junction between the sub-cells and match their currents. The research outcomes will advance fundamental scientific understanding of multi-junction solar cell performance while developing fabrication strategies that will enable for scalable industrial manufacture of devices potentially capable of delivering 30% solar energy conversion efficiency. The principal investigators will also use the research outcomes to enhance instructional materials in photovoltaics course offerings at Yale University and Arizona State University.","04/04/2017","04/04/2017","1736181","Minjoo","Lee","mllee@illinois.edu","04/04/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","7644","ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY","146E","Solar energy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

More specifically, it focuses on the study of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are a very special class of functions that form an important bridge connecting the discrete objects of algebraic number theory and the continuous objects of analytic number theory. Automorphic forms are used as tools to study number theoretic functions, e.g. by measuring their rates of growth, discovering formulas for them, or proving relations that they satisfy. Classically, special values of automorphic forms provided the solution to Kronecker's problem for extensions of the rational numbers that do not lie in the real line. More recently, automorphic forms played a pivotal role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. This project aims to further explore the connection of automorphic forms to other mathematical structures.<br/><br/>The main object of the proposed research is to further understand and exploit the relationship between automorphic forms and quadratic number fields. This relationship is exceedingly rich and unites the study of diverse objects such as Heegner points, closed geodesics, the hyperbolic Laplacian, Kloosterman sums, L-functions and class fields. The theory for imaginary quadratic fields is in general better developed and simpler, especially in relation to class field theory. The investigators will concentrate mostly on the real quadratic case. In one direction, they will study some new geometric invariants associated to real quadratic fields that were introduced recently. These invariants are certain surfaces that are bounded by modular closed geodesics. The investigators will study the distribution of the areas of the surfaces, especially as this relates to ideal classes and also investigate some new geometric problems about the closed geodesics. They plan to express various invariants for real quadratic fields (such as surface integrals of modular functions) in terms of the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms. This naturally leads to problems involving sums of Kloosterman sums and to extensions of recent work on uniform estimates for such sums.","04/05/2017","04/05/2017","1701638","Nickolas","Andersen","nandersen@math.ucla.edu","04/05/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"William","Duke","wdduke@ucla.edu","04/05/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many concern questions that current numerics and experiment are not adequate to resolve. Several of the planned subprojects involve numerically assisted proof using scientific computation with guaranteed error bounds, up to and including rigorous numerical proof. An integral part of the project is the simultaneous development of a user-friendly numerical platform, STABLAB, for numerical stability investigation, and the systematic exploration with this platform of physical behavior in gas and fluid dynamics in the delicate situations of reacting or ionized flow. <br/><br/>The problems addressed involve issues in dynamical systems, singular perturbation theory, spectral theory of linear operators, nonlinear partial differential equations, and rigorous scientific computation, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. In particular, development of dynamical systems tools for kinetic shock and boundary layer problems would unify and extend results obtained for Boltzmann phenomena by the ""Kyoto School"" of Sone et al using a variety of formal and analytic methods. Likewise, the introduction of new inviscid stability criteria for roll waves and of Kreiss symmetrizer techniques for analysis of modulated fronts open new directions in the study of periodic modulation.

In the last ten to fifteen years there has been a drive to understand a more general question: Find primes in integer sequences associated to infinite groups of symmetries of finite-dimensional spaces. Formulation of this general question followed the realization that many fundamental integer sequences are connected to groups of symmetries, for example the entries of Pythagorean triples, curvatures appearing in Apollonian circle packings, and the denominators of continued fractions formed using only a finite alphabet. In many important cases, the relevant group of symmetries is 'thin,' meaning that it is sparser than expected, and hence is not subject to classical techniques. As a result, new technology that draws on many different areas of mathematics has been developed to treat questions about thin groups and their associated integer sequences. The research in this project will study primes in integer sequences that arise in the study of moduli spaces. A moduli space is a mathematical object that encodes all geometric structures of a given type on an object, up to natural identifications. Moduli spaces often have associated groups of symmetries. These are built from integers, and so invite many intriguing number theoretic questions. In fact, these symmetry groups are sometimes thin, giving surprising new applications of the theory of thin groups. <br/><br/>The PI will study two types of counting problems. The first concerns the number fields associated to periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow on moduli spaces of abelian differentials. The PI has recently generalized Selberg's 3/16 Theorem to higher genus moduli spaces. This result will be used to obtain a congruence count for periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow. In addition, Selberg's Theorem will be extended to affine invariant submanifolds of moduli space. The second type of problem concerns the Markoff-Hurwitz affine variety and its automorphism group. The PI will study the prime factors of the coordinates of integer points on this variety by obtaining congruence lattice point counting estimates and using sieve methods. This requires understanding the orbits of the automorphism group on the points of the variety over finite fields, and extensions of this question to square-free moduli. Questions about the statistics of the series of permutations obtained by the actions of a fixed global automorphism on the points on the variety over various finite fields will be studied. These questions are related to surprising numerical results obtained in collaboration with undergraduate students.","04/05/2017","04/05/2017","1701357","Michael","Magee","michael.magee@yale.edu","04/05/2017","Principal Investigator","Yale University","New Haven","065208327","2037854689","Office of Sponsored Projects","United States","Connecticut","CT","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In his earlier research, the principal investigator (PI) created new tools for optimal transport theory, a theory which has experienced a mathematical renaissance over the last twenty-five years by weaving together threads from analysis, geometry, partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamical systems. Motivated by his work on systems with large numbers of particles, the PI, with collaborators, has discovered some connections between optimal transportation, games with a large number of players, and Mean Field Games. These unexpected connections open doors to several new avenues of research, some of which being described in this proposal. The goal of this project is to advance knowledge in various other related topics. This includes the geometry of the space of closed differential forms with the non--linear factorization of differential forms. This proposal involves training students, mentoring postdocs and organizing learning seminars for graduate students. The PI will remain involved in national as well as international activities. These, constitute the broader impacts of the proposed activities. <br/><br/>The PI studies the mathematical aspects of Density Functional Theory (DFT), as well as certain geometric clustering problems originating in combinatorial optimization. What many of these problems have in common, and what is sometimes novel in the approach for studying them, is their formulation on infinite dimensional ``manifolds'' equipped with metric, differential, and symplectic pseudo-structures. This infinite dimensional setting often lead to a new outlook and --at least on the formal level-- to novel and simpler approaches to otherwise complex problems. A typical example is how Otto's calculus turns many nonlinear PDEs into gradient flows of geodesically convex functionals. In a similar fashion, our searching for geodesic of minimal lengths on the set of differential forms, leads to a new concept of ``quasiconvexity,"" that looks like an extension of the concept originally introduced by C. Morrey and used extensively in non--linear elasticity theory. Part of the challenge, however, includes turning formal arguments into rigorous ones to yield new results. The intellectual merit of the research is that the problems to be studied have the potential of revealing principles which can be extended to a more general context.","04/05/2017","04/05/2017","1700202","Wilfrid","Gangbo","wgangbo@math.ucla.edu","04/05/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program targets the synthesis of new compounds with technological applications, specifically thermoelectric applications. Thermoelectric materials can convert a heat gradient into electricity. The design of efficient thermoelectric devices is a major goal for energy conversion technologies. Zintl phases, which are a subset of intermetallics are ideal candidates for thermoelectric applications as they are semiconductors with complex structures which provide low thermal conductivity, which allows for precise tuning of carrier concentration. In this structure-property relationship study specific Zintl structures will be targeted to test ideas for property outcomes based on atomic-level modifications. The long-term goal is to discover new highly efficient thermoelectric materials. Short term goals include building an understanding of best Zintl structures for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and discovery of new magnetic and electronic properties for other technological applications. With this NSF grant the principal investigator helps educate the next generation of the STEM workforce. Students from high school through graduate school are provided hands-on training and their scientific and social skills are developed through workshops and individual mentorship. The next generation of scientists is trained to consider novel materials and their impact on technology for our future energy needs and specifically thermoelectrics.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This grant supports fundamental research efforts to prepare new Zintl phase compounds and measure their properties with a goal of discovering new thermoelectric materials and enhancing their thermoelectric properties. The research focuses on studying a) new variants of 14-1-11 Zintl phases for which high zT is expected at high temperatures, and b) novel Europium-based materials exhibiting low thermal conductivity. New compounds are synthesized as single crystals, high purity powders and pellets via flux, metallurgical routes, and spark plasma sintering. A suite of physical characterization techniques is utilized, including single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe, electrical and magnetic measurements. Structure and phase composition is subsequently correlated with electronic and thermal transport properties. With this NSF grant the principal investigator mentors science students starting their science careers in high school to undergraduates in partnerships with graduate students, ultimately providing professional training for scientific careers.

This study combines next gen sequencing with classical mutation accumulation (MA) studies to describe sequence-level mutation rates. The researchers will employ whole genome sequencing to quantify the mutation rate and the spectrum of mutations in multiple genetic backgrounds of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequencing will be done on 100 MA lines derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been assessed for performance in six natural field environments. Additional sequencing will include 40 lines from each of 8 additional sets of MA lines, established from naturally-collected founder genotypes from France and Sweden, and 50 lines from natural North American selections that have been identified to contain a unique haplotype grouping and divergence pattern of mutations similar to that found in classical MA lines. These data will estimate with much greater accuracy the type and rates of spontaneous mutation at the sequence level and will allow the research team to decompose the spectrum of mutations and connect them to field performance. <br/><br/>The synthesis of these datasets will enable the determination of which types of mutations are more likely to be beneficial, deleterious or neutral, and whether the effects of certain types of identified mutations are consistent across environments. There are societal, scientific and educational broader impacts to improving our understanding of mutations in plants. Mutation rates are important in plant breeding, in predicting evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds, and in predicting evolutionary responses of plants to major environmental changes such as climate change.

In order to attain materials with custom-designed optical characteristics, judiciously engineered combinations of materials such as metals, semiconductors and insulators must be devised. These new artificial materials, commonly referred to as metamaterials, are fabricated to be much thinner than the wavelength of light. Potential applications of such metamaterials include devices capable of controlling and switching light at very high speeds, as well as infrared sensors and light detectors. Research efforts encompass computational design, materials fabrication, and optical characterization of the metamaterials. The research team comprises two graduate students, who are assisted during the summer months by an undergraduate student as well as a student from a local high school. All participating students receive training in modern materials fabrication techniques, laser operation, and computer simulation methods. An on-going coordination with the University of Texas at San Antonio - a designated Hispanic Serving Institution - is used to recruit summer students for this project.<br/><br/>Technical description: The research team is exploiting several unique synergies between plasmonic metasurfaces and two-dimensional (2D) materials, by harnessing the ability of metasurfaces to concentrate optical energy to the extreme optical nonlinearities of 2D materials in the mid-IR. In this way it is utilizing plasmonic metasurfaces as gating electrodes to engineer the quantum properties of 2D materials. This enables a new regime of strong optical coupling in hybrid plasmonic-2D systems. The gating metasurface electrodes are additionally used to periodically modulate the chemical potential of the 2D material, resulting in a quantum Bragg reflector for surface graphene plasmons - a novel concept that bridges materials science and optics. Using first-principles modeling, advanced fabrication and optical characterization, plasmonic metasurfaces are fabricated and integrated with 2D materials to create these new hybrid materials. Unique optical characteristics of this system, such as anomalously high optical nonlinearities and ultrafast response, are explored and utilized for efficient optical harmonics generation as well as in ultrafast nonlinear optical devices.","04/05/2017","04/05/2017","1741788","Gennady","Shvets","gs656@cornell.edu","04/05/2017","Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","1712","DMR SHORT TERM SUPPORT","7234","SENSORS NON-SOLICITATION RESEA","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8614","Nanomaterials","8990","Optics and Photonics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1775",NA,NA,NA,"ELECTRONIC/PHOTONIC MATERIALS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Prairie View A&M University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to access energy resources with vast available space and fewer restrictions and regulations. The project seeks to analyze floating offshore wind turbine uncertainties that arise due to the ocean environment and hydrodynamic calculations, as well as due to uncertainties in the structural and mechanical systems, which threaten the reliability and the feasibility of FOWTs. Undergraduate students, high school students and students from community colleges will gain research experiences through this project. <br/><br/>The current floating offshore wind turbine technologies have challenges to be resolved in order to produce sustainable and cost-effective power. Semi-submersible type FOWTs are known to be one of the most promising options with construction and maintenance cost problems yet to be solved. This project focuses on identification of the uncertainties and on estimating the structural safety factors. The research objectives of this project are to: understand the uncertainties that exist in FOWTs; predict the structural behavior and life-cycle structural reliability of FOWTs; and obtain safety factors for structural design of semi-submersible-type FOWTs that uniquely consider the uncertainties and coupled dynamics of aerodynamics of the wind turbine and hydrodynamics of the floating body under extreme environmental loads. By considering the uncertainties found, the probabilistic capacity and demand models for structural components of FOWTs will be developed using a Bayesian Method. Lastly, the developed models will be used to estimate the life-cycle structural reliability and to obtain the safety factors for the base tower moment and shear forces of FOWTs. The results of this research may eventually reduce the current challenge of the high cost of FOWTs.","04/05/2017","04/05/2017","1700406","Doeun","Choe","DOChoe@pvamu.edu","04/05/2017","Principal Investigator","Prairie View A & M University","Prairie View","774460519","9362611689","P.O.

This project concerns a powerful technique, called deformation-rigidity theory, to study these opposing phenomena in the framework of von Neumann algebras, i.e., algebras of infinite matrices, where the product of two elements, A times B, may be different from the product in reverse order, B times A, a fact that reflects the laws of quantum mechanics in particle physics (Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle). Von Neumann algebras are also related to group theory and ergodic theory, since transformations of spaces give rise to a special class of such algebras called II1 factors. Rigidity in this context occurs when the group of transformations can be recognized by merely knowing its associated II1 factor (which is a very coarse object). The study of rigidity of factors is an interdisciplinary endeavor and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics. It also has applications to computer science, complexity theory, design computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. This research project aims to deepen understanding in this important area.<br/><br/>The principal investigator recently added several new tools to this study, namely an approximation/simulation technique, a representation theory, and a cohomology. In this project, he intends to combine all these tools to further study rigidity-versus-randomness phenomena in II1 factors and to tackle several famous problems in this area: the Connes Approximate Embedding (CAE) conjecture, the sofic group problem, the free group factor problem, the paving problem, and calculations of invariants for group-like objects. It should be noted that the CAE conjecture, which predicts that II1 factors can be ""simulated"" on a computer, would have striking consequences in quantum information theory.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1700344","Sorin","Popa","popa@math.ucla.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Palka","This project aims to study several phenomena in the broad category of nonlinear dispersive problems. These problems arise from varied domains of physics, such as the interaction between the structure of space-time and matter in general relativity, the influence of changes in the topography on the propagation of ocean waves, or simply some toy models from plasma physics and laser propagation devised to understand the possible buildup of energy in smaller dispersive channels. These situations are different and yet all result from complex interactions between several different ""modes of propagation"" combining to create new dynamics that cannot simply be predicted by looking at each component of the system in isolation. A better understanding of these effects allows one then to develop better and simpler models that accurately describe the behavior of the system under consideration for large time. The objective of this project is to describe in detail examples where such effects are relevant and to highlight the underlying common mathematical structure, while at the same time isolating the specific features responsible for each particular phenomenology.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the study of the long-time behavior of three different nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive systems in cases where scattering does not hold and nonlinear effects have a strong impact on the qualitative behavior of solutions. The principal investigator will consider the following: (i) a problem from general relativity, namely, the stability of Minkowski space for the Einstein equations in the presence of a massive scalar field; (ii) a model (NLS) problem that involves the possible growth of Sobolev norms on domains of smaller volume; (iii) a model from water-wave theory that seeks to demonstrate how a sudden and localized change in the bottom topography influences the propagation of solitary waves. In each case the principal investigator will focus on controlling solutions globally using a combination of Fourier and harmonic analysis, bilinear estimates, ordinary differential equations and geometric methods (vector fields, normal forms, tools from Hamiltonian dynamics), and adapted function spaces. The objective is to derive improved ""effective"" dynamics that control asymptotic behavior.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1700282","Benoit","Pausader","Benoit_Pausader@brown.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Brown University","Providence","029129002","4018632777","BOX 1929","United States","Rhode Island","RI","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Theory predicts that rapid adaptation can also potentially affect the establishment of species in new habitats, but there is little evidence from natural systems to support this. This project will investigate rapid adaptation in recently established plant populations, as well as how symbiotic microbes might influence plant rapid adaptation. By conducting this work at an ecological restoration site, this project will not only expand our understanding of basic ecological processes, but results of the project can be applied to make restorations more successful. This is important, as the restoration of degraded landscapes can play a critical role in biodiversity conservation, yet species sown into restorations often fail to establish. Additionally, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate students and development of online educational materials for K-12 students.<br/><br/>By using field experiments, reciprocal transplants, and greenhouse studies, this project aims to expand understanding of the role of rapid adaptation in population establishment in several ways. First, although empirical evidence suggests that evolution may occur rapidly enough to influence establishment, few studies consider the demographic effects of adaptation. This study will examine the demographic effects of adaptation in recently established plant populations. Second, this work aims to identify the selective agents and traits responsible for local adaptation, which few studies attempt to do. By combining selection analyses with reciprocal transplant experiments, this study will both predict evolutionary responses and test whether those predicted evolutionary shifts have actually occurred. Finally, this work will investigate the role of microbial mutualists in plant rapid adaptation by examining interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria and how traits mediating interactions with rhizobia have evolved in response to field environments that differ in soil nutrient availability and rhizobium community properties. The results of this work will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between rapid adaptation and population establishment.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1701791","Jennifer","Lau","jenlau@msu.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Susan","Magnoli","magnolis@msu.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bacteria are the engines that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles and help to sustain life. Scientific papers are published daily on what types of bacteria live in every imaginable ecosystem. Scientists have found patterns of bacteria community composition in relation to environmental (e.g. temperature, pH, etc.) or host (e.g. disease history, cancer state, etc.) characteristics, but the underlying reasons for the observed patterns remain unclear. Connecting these patterns to a general conceptual framework of how microbes interact with each other and their environment will help scientists to better manage microbes in systems that directly affect people such as human pathogens and wastewater treatment plants. This research will be a step towards addressing this gap in knowledge by adapting frameworks developed in plant systems based on functional characteristics (traits) to microbial ecology, allowing examination of connections between lake bacterial diversity and ecosystems processes using a mechanistic approach. A computational workflow of this project's analysis will be publicly available and used to create open access online educational tools to aid in teaching computational analyses, scientific reproducibility, and programming literacy. Finally, this workflow will be put together to teach a half day workshop at the Ecological Society of America conference. <br/><br/>This research examines how the relationship between bacterial diversity and secondary productivity is constrained by the traits that determine community assembly. Through a comparative genomic analysis of published and newly reconstructed bacterial genomes from environmental genomic data, this project will identify DNA-inferred (a) response traits that control the differences in bacterial community composition and (b) effect traits that determine the presence or absence of a diversity-productivity relationship. The identified genes and inferred traits will help expand current understanding of how bacterial community assembly and processes affect ecosystem function. This understanding will improve linkages between microbial community and ecosystem ecology principles.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1701467","Vincent","Denef","vdenef@umich.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Michigan Ann Arbor","Ann Arbor","481091274","7347636438","3003 South State St. Room 1062","United States","Michigan","MI","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marian","Schmidt","marschmi@umich.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Similar to humans, and animals in general, plants harbor diverse microbial communities, including fungi. Mosses are a major component of boreal, arctic and alpine vegetation, which are most drastically impacted by environmental variation. They are known to host diverse fungal communities, living inside plant tissues (endophytic), such as leaves, without causing any visible symptoms. Endophytic fungi can actually help living plants in various ways, including the improvement of nutrient uptake and protection from pathogens. However, fungi are also known to be proficient decomposers of dead plant material. Switches between these functional states by fungi might be dynamic and potentially regulated by abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding the circumstances and mechanisms by which these functional transitions occur will greatly improve knowledge of plant-fungus interactions and their roles as symbiotic entities to maintain nutrient cycling and ecosystem functions. The researchers will participate in various outreach activities, including the annual Darwin Day exhibition event at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. This grant will greatly improve the co-PI's Ph.D. dissertation, and contribute to the development of an independent research program for a successful academic career. <br/><br/>Previously, the researchers have examined endophytic fungal species and their function across a senescence gradient within moss plants using an innovative metatranscriptomic approach. Although active fungal species were found to be structured according to the senescence gradient of the moss, several fungi inhabit both the living (top) and decomposing (bottom) portions of the plant, providing multiple candidate fungal species to study trophic transitions between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism. The researchers will isolate some of these fungi in pure cultures and use them in an experiment designed to quantify the effects of focal fungal strains on living and dead moss tissues. Using co-culture experiments of these fungi with moss plants, this project will characterize the phenotypic, and transcriptomic, responses of mosses to their associated fungi. This research will use also the same moss-fungus system to monitor differential gene expression associated with a switch between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism by three very different fungal species.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1701836","Ko-Hsuan","Chen","ko.hsuan.chen@duke.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Duke University","Durham","277054010","9196843030","2200 W.

An understudied consequence of this movement is that alpine species, which cannot move further up mountains, may become rarer because of more competition with the upward migrating species. Could this intensified competition be strong enough to cause species extinctions? This research will provide one of the few experimental tests of this scenario, using alpine plant communities of the southern Rocky Mountains, CO, USA. This project expands upon past work by coupling competition experiments with mathematical models to predict population growth into the future and to generalize the results to other ecosystems. This research will provide new insights for the management of alpine and other ecosystems under variable temperature and precipitation patterns, specifically for species important in wildlife management, recreation, and restoration. In addition, this project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students and the public by utilizing the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Science Festival and Kids Nature Camp outreach programs.<br/><br/>The researchers have used niche models to inform an experiment that transplanted alpine species into the low elevation plant communities expected to encroach upslope. Results suggest that focal alpine species performance is reduced more by low elevation plant communities than by resident alpine communities. The researchers are combining demographic data from natural populations with field manipulations of competition to parameterize integral projection models. These models are aimed at long-term predictions of focal species population growth under experimental conditions to determine their viability in a competitive environment altered by increased temperatures. This project will generalize these results to a wider set of systems and species. The researchers will collect plant trait and environmental data on focal species and competing communities to parameterize a new trait-based model aimed at predicting competitive interaction outcomes from differences in species traits.

In recent years, there has been a recognition that such effects can be employed in cooling, for example, in air-conditioning or refrigeration, and that these magnetic cooling technologies can potentially even replace more conventional ways of cooling involving compression/expansion cycles. This fundamental study of the structure of known and new materials as they are exposed to changes in the temperature and the strength of the magnetic field is carried out with funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program. The goal of this project is to identify how known materials can be expected to perform in useful devices, as well as inform the search for new and improved materials that could lead to further improvements in efficient cooling. Estimates are that cooling technologies consume as much as a fifth of the total energy used. Better materials and a better understanding of processes for cooling, both of which are target goals of this project, are therefore of national interest in terms of the US staying at the forefront of this important emerging technology. <br/><br/>Part 2: Technical<br/><br/>Changes in the temperature of magnetic materials due to applied magnetic fields were noted as long ago as 1881, the huge interest in the utility of this effect in employing magnetocaloric materials for cooling near room temperature is however more recent. While paramagnetic materials can be employed for cooling at very low temperatures, for applications near room temperatures and for applications of modest magnetic fields, the strongest effects are observed in materials close to their ferromagnetic Curie temperatures. The systems of interest in this project are 3d transition-metal based ferromagnets with Curie temperatures near room temperature. The main focus of the proposed work is on materials with structure types derived from the aluminum diboride structural aristotype, and are characterized by their ability to host two magnetic atoms. Typically, one of the two magnetic atoms is manganese. In many magnetocalorics, the magnetic transition appears to be associated with a structural change. To investigate this further, this research is guided by answering the following two questions: (i) How do the crystal structures change as ferromagnetic transitions are traversed with magnetic field or by cooling through the transition temperature, and what are the implications for magnetocaloric cooling? and (ii) Can metamagnetic transitions (i.e. spin-state transitions) be designed into materials in such a way that the entropy change associated with turning on a magnetic field is enhanced? The experimental aspect of the research focuses on known magnetocaloric materials as well as the discovery of new ones.

This technology has been used to identify areas of the genome that differ between populations occurring in different environments, and which may be important in preventing closely-related species from forming hybrids. This project uses similar methods to compare populations that differ in whether they co-exist with a close relative with which they can hybridize. The project focuses on orangethroat darter fish. The project will identify genome areas associated with a preference to mate with one's own species, and test whether the same genetic changes happen in all closely-related species that coexist, or whether unique genetic changes occur each time. Data obtained from this study will provide critical insight into how differences in biological communities can drive species diversity. This project will provide valuable research opportunities and teaching materials for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used to educate community members about the biology of local native fish species. <br/><br/>Reinforcement plays a critical role in finalizing the process of speciation after secondary contact by increasing prezygotic isolation between taxa that produce unfit hybrids. As reinforcement directly selects for divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations, it can also incidentally lead to behavioral isolation among populations within species (i.e., cascade reinforcement). The objective of this project is to develop genomic tools to examine how reinforcement affects genome-wide divergence between and within species in two groups of darters (the orangethroat darter clade Ceasia and the rainbow darter Etheostoma caeruleum). Previous studies have provided strong behavioral evidence that reinforcement is driving behavioral isolation between sympatric Ceasia and E. caeruleum, and subsequently causing cascade reinforcement and behavioral isolation between species within Ceasia. This research will examine genomic divergence between species experiencing reinforcement, and investigate whether this divergence between species may incidentally be causing genomic divergence among populations within species (or among recently diverged species). Specifically, Next-Generation Sequencing will be utilized to (1) identify any differences in chromosomal structure between Ceasia and E. caeruleum that may be contributing to postzygotic isolation and facilitating reinforcement, (2) identify loci responsible for postzygotic isolation between Ceasia and E. caeruleum by genotyping hybrid and backcross individuals, and (3) conduct genome scans that compare genetic differentiation between multiple populations of Ceasia that are sympatric and allopatric with respect to E. caeruleum, in order to identify highly differentiated outlier loci between sympatric and allopatric populations that are likely associated with prezygotic isolation.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1701676","Rebecca","Fuller","fuller@life.uiuc.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","7659","ANIMAL BEHAVIOR","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rachel","Moran","rachelmoran28@gmail.com","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They have applications ranging from industrial waste-heat recovery, to remote sensing, to space exploration. High efficiency thermoelectric materials need to simultaneously exhibit high electrical conductivity, a large Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. This combination of properties is exceptionally difficult to achieve. Materials with highly anisotropic crystal structures offer a potential strategy to increase the thermoelectric efficiency, because their physical properties display different values when measured along different crystallographic directions. The goal of the research funded by this award from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program is to develop a powerful and adaptable method for single crystal growth of compounds with complex, anisotropic crystal structures. Characterizing these large crystals advances our understanding of the fundamental connection between the atomic structure of materials and the anisotropic thermal and electronic behavior, providing routes to enhanced thermoelectric efficiency. This interdisciplinary and collaborative project utilizes facilities at the NSF-supported PARADIM Materials Innovation Platform. With this Solid State and Materials Chemistry funded award graduate and undergraduate students are trained in solid state synthesis and physics of materials; the principal investigator also leverages results from this grant for outreach activities such as the 'Introduce a Girl to Engineering' day, the 'Lady Spartans Engineering Summer Camp' and in-class activities at local high schools. <br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Summary<br/><br/>The research for this award is based on the understanding that one of the most fundamental conflicts in the design of thermoelectric materials - the need for simultaneous high electronic mobility and a high density of states near the Fermi level - can be circumvented by exploiting anisotropic electronic transport. Zintl intermetallic phases, with their vast structural variety and excellent high-temperature thermoelectric performance, stand out as an intriguing subject area for the study of thermal and electronic transport anisotropy. Although theoretical studies predict significant thermoelectric efficiency gains along the covalently-bonded, high-conductivity directions in some Zintl phases, experimental confirmation is lacking due to the difficulty of growing single crystals suitable for transport measurements. With this grant from the Solid State Materials Chemistry program the principal investigator aims to bridge this gap between theory and experiment by adapting the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) crystal growth technique to the growth of large Zintl single crystals. The TSFZ technique is a crucible-less method that combines flux growth and directional solidification and is particularly well-suited for refractory compounds with incongruent melting transitions. It is a natural extension of flux growth - a historically successful method for the growth of Zintl crystals - but it allows for the growth of larger crystals suitable for transport measurements. Zintl antimonides, which exhibit high thermoelectric efficiency even in polycrystalline form, are the focus of this work. Characterization of the grown crystals combined with first principles investigations are used to explore the link between polyanion dimensionality and transport, with an emphasis on the anisotropy of electron and phonon velocities and scattering rates. This project applies a closed-loop approach to material design and selection by directly validating theoretical predictions, thus leading to a more complete picture of anisotropic transport behavior in complex semiconductors used in a broad range of applications. At the same time results from this research are leveraged for outreach activities such as the 'Introduce a Girl to Engineering' day, the 'Lady Spartans Engineering Summer Camp' and in-class activities at local high schools.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1709158","Alexandra","Zevalkink","alexzev@msu.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Michigan State University","East Lansing","488242600","5173555040","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Michigan","MI","1762","SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS","8396","Clean Energy Technology","8611","Energy Efficiency and End Use",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, biologists have suggested that these microbes may play a critical role in shaping plant health and ecology. Most work so far has relied on comparative studies of microbes among different plant species; the next step forward is to manipulate plant microbial communities to better understand how they influence their host plants. In this study, researchers will manipulate the abundance and presence of fungi and bacteria in spotted locoweed plants. Spotted locoweed hosts a fungus that synthesizes a potent, bioactive compound that can harm livestock. This fungus is carried in seeds, and is thus passed down to the next generation of locoweeds. The interaction between these fungi and their locoweed hosts is responsible for millions of dollars in damages annually in the Western United States, yet little is known regarding how these fungi affect the ability of their hosts to grow and reproduce. In addition, many other microbes inhabit locoweeds, most with unknown ecological roles. Researchers will manipulate microbes in locoweeds to better understand the function and importance of the entire microbial communities in these important plants. Because microbes occur in all plants, results from this experiment will have implications that extend across many plants beyond locoweed, including agricultural crops. Researchers will include local high school students in the scientific process, will present findings to the scientific community, and will make results accessible to the general public.<br/><br/>The experiment will test the hypothesis that colonization of plants by endophytic microbes influences plant trait expression.

Variation among treatment groups in plant traits, including reproductive and defensive traits, will be assayed. Additionally, arthropod, fungal, and bacterial communities of each treatment group will be characterized and co-occurrence patterns analyzed to understand how members of the plant microbiome influence one another and plant-associated arthropods.

Compared with inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, the molecular variety available for organic semiconductors, thanks to synthetic organic chemistry, offers near limitless potential. When combined with materials science, this rich molecular tapestry suggests availability of extraordinary control over optical and mechanical properties, materials cost, environmental impact, and simplicity of device construction. Efficient transfer of energy in the solid state is one of the fundamental aspects of both light-emitting and light harvesting devices. A better understanding of the relationship between molecular design and the transfer of energy in organic materials enables design of a broad range of more efficient next-generation optical and electronic devices. This research targets one of the energy transfer mechanisms that historically received less attention, a mechanism known as exchange. This mechanism is operative in all molecular systems, and a better understanding of how it contributes to energy transfer in the solid state will open the door to a broad range of new, and more efficient organic electronics. This project includes introducing thousands of third through sixth grade students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to the fundamental concept of energy and the basic idea of pursuing a college education in a STEM field.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The first step in exciton transport is inter-chromophore energy transfer. Historically, simplicity has promoted binary association of emissive materials with an inductive transfer mechanism and non-emissive materials with an exchange mechanism. This distinction has not always been consistent with observation. This research is developing a better understanding of the role of each mechanism. Experimental accessibility has focused previous attention on luminescent systems. Realizing that the high molecular density inherent to devices facilitates exchange, and acknowledging that exchange does not have the same limitations as induction, this work is filling gaps in the understanding of transport in non-luminescent materials. At the same time, this work is elucidating the combined roles of both mechanisms. Employing methodologies to probe exciton diffusion in both luminescent and non-luminescent materials, this work is elucidating ways to exploit combined approaches to transport, quantifying parasitic exciton quenching via annihilation and polaron trapping, and measuring the effects of exciton fission on energy transport. Taken in aggregate, this research is providing a significant contribution to the understanding of exciton transport in organic semiconductors and developing design principles to enhance the next generation of light harvesting and light-emitting devices.

How can we provide everyone with a cheap way to capture and use the sun's energy to run their appliances and vehicles? Rooftop silicon-based photovoltaic cells already exist for converting sunlight into electricity; however, these cells are expensive to manufacture and install. This project's goal is to study solar cells made from plastics and organic molecules, which could allow solar cells to be as thin and inexpensive as a coat of paint. Plastic/organic solar-cell materials have been studied for a long time, but how these materials convert light into electricity at the molecular level remains poorly understood. To better understand these materials we are developing a microscope capable of watching charge move at the molecular level on the timescale of one nanosecond (one billionth of a second) or faster. Such a microscope would give us a new way to study molecular-level processes ranging from photosynthesis to industrially important chemical reactions taking place at a metal surface. The researchers funded by this project are using their knowledge of scientific instrumentation and computer programming to develop experiments introducing middle and high school students to topics ranging from the physics of music to the principles of electrochemistry.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The goal of this project is to test molecular design rules thought to govern how light is converted into electricity in thin-film solar cells made from electron-accepting and electron-donating molecules, so-called donor-acceptor blends. Localized measurements of charge recombination dynamics and charge mobility are carried out on donor-acceptor blends prepared from molecules with systematically varied energy levels and background charge density to support or refute theories describing how charge is generated from sunlight in these blends. To enable these studies, scanned-probe-microscope measurements are developed capable of determining, with nanosecond temporal resolution and nanometer spatial resolution, the free charge yield and subsequent recombination dynamics in a thin film of a donor-acceptor blend following the application of a nanosecond-duration pulse of light. A separate set of scanned-probe measurements are developed for inferring the local charge mobility from measurements of near-surface electric field fluctuations. The tools created during this project are expected to ultimately have broad applications in studying industrially important processes like photocatalysis and electrocatalysis and in naturally important processes like photosynthesis. The researchers funded by this research are using their knowledge of scientific instrumentation and computer programming to develop experiments introducing middle and high school students to topics ranging from the physics of music to the principles of electrochemistry.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1709879","John","Marohn","jam99@cornell.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","Cornell University","Ithaca","148502820","6072555014","373 Pine Tree Road","United States","New York","NY","1762","SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS","8396","Clean Energy Technology","8607","Solar Energy Capture&Conver",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

O'Connor","Strengthening community resilience to natural disasters is important in all communities, including in the residential sector. In some instances, homeowners may survive a hazard event yet still experience significant direct and indirect losses that, when aggregated over entire communities, can impede recovery following major disasters. Reduction of future losses may require homeowners to undertake voluntary actions to reduce risks to their residences. This research will focus on the role of social and cultural factors, including religiosity, in motivating homeowners to be proactive. This research will conduct homeowner surveys in two Haitian communities whose residential sectors were respectively devastated by 2016's Hurricane Matthew and the 2010 Earthquake. Understanding the attitudes and behaviors of these extremely vulnerable homeowners can in turn inform efforts to encourage proactive risk reduction among similar communities in the United States. Such findings will inform the development of programming enabling cultural and social institutions to move beyond their historical roles as key actors in response and recovery and become drivers of proactive risk reduction.<br/><br/>Homeowner decisions to reduce risk to natural hazards like hurricanes and earthquakes are likely constrained by complex social, economic, and political forces, including the role of important social and cultural institutions. The specific practices of these institutions may vary considerably even within those of a particular type, and may be associated with corresponding differences in the posture of adherents towards various hazards. The recent (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) and more distant history of US disasters has shown, for example, that institutional affiliation may inform risk seeking/avoidance behavior. This study pays particular attention to the role of religiosity in determining homeowner agency to rebuild for resiliency. Other variables tested for their effects on risk-reducing homeowner behavior include the severity of prior disaster damage (quantified by engineering forensic assessments), perceptions of future natural hazard risk, and time elapsed since prior disaster experience. Data used in this investigation will be generated from face-to-face homeowner surveys distributed to 500 primary decision makers of single family residences in each of the two demographically similar communities in Haiti, Les Cayes and Leogane. Residents of Les Cayes are in the early stages of recovery following 2016's Hurricane Matthew, where intent toward risk reducing construction can be documented. By contrast, respondents in Leogane, the epicenter of the 2010 Earthquake, have had six years to navigate the steps of rebuilding and demonstrate actions toward risk reduction, allowing a comparative evaluation between intent and action in household recovery. Given the lack of accurate census data for random sampling, respondents are selected through modified random walk protocols. Data analysis includes basic descriptive statistics (frequencies and cross-tabs) for the two communities and multivariate analysis on the Structural Risk Mitigation Index, a quantitative indicator of the homeowner's proactive response toward resilience-enhancing construction.","04/06/2017","04/06/2017","1715197","Karen","Richman","krichman@nd.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Notre Dame","NOTRE DAME","465565708","5746317432","940 Grace Hall","United States","Indiana","IN","1321","DECISION RISK & MANAGEMENT SCI","042E","HAZARD AND DISASTER RESPONSE","7914","RAPID","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Debra","Javeline","Javeline@nd.edu","04/06/2017","Principal Investigator","1638",NA,NA,NA,"INFRAST MGMT & EXTREME EVENTS",NA,"Tracy","Kijewski-Correa","tkijewsk@nd.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Alexandros","Taflanidis","Alexandros.A.Taflanidis.1@nd.edu","04/06/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"1020","EAGER: GOALI: Crown Ether-enhanced Electrodialysis for Selective Removal of Problematic Ions in Feed Water and Waste Fluid of Unconventional Energy Production","04/15/2017","03/31/2018","79947","Standard Grant","07020000","Directorate For Engineering","Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys","William Cooper","1701512<br/>Yan<br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop an innovative selective desalination technology using membranes specifically designed for the treatment of feed water and wastewater of unconventional oil and gas production. Sustainable development of unconventional oil and gas production relies on efficient use of water resources and safe disposal of effluent from hydraulic fracturing processes. A key to attaining these goals lies in the effective removal of a subset of contaminants amid high levels of background electrolytes in alternative (brackish) water sources and in the waste water produced during unconventional oil and gas production operations.<br/><br/>Species of key interest in this project include barium (II) and strontium (II), which give rise to scaling problems and interfere with the proper function of gelling agents. The project will involve close collaboration among two university PIs from Chemistry and Environmental Engineering at Texas Tech and an industrial co-PI with extensive experience in water management for a major oil and gas production company, this proposal will explore conjugating commercial electrodialysis membranes with optimized supported crown ether moieties to enable selective binding and transport of target contaminants in electrodialysis processes. The objective of this project is to develop a class of electrodialysis membranes with novel ion-gating functionality for selective removal of problematic ions in alternative brackish water sources for energy production uses. The central hypothesis of this research is that intrinsic ion selectivity of electrodialysis processes can be significantly improved by incorporating a thin layer of ion sequestrants of suitable structure and density at the surface of electrodialysis membranes, creating localized concentration gradients driving highly selective transport of the target ions. The PIs ability to prepare crown ethers of diverse conformations and to adapt their molecular structure for optimal metal binding specificity renders the proposed technology a versatile method for selective ion separation. One attractive application is to enable the use of alternative water sources for hydraulic fracturing operations. In this one-year project, the project will focus on the removal of two ions of primary concerns to unconventional oil and gas production, namely, Ba2+ and Sr2+, although the concept can in principle be extended to other problematic ions, such as Ra2+, which is the major source of radio-activity in naturally occurring radioactive material and its disposal is subject to stringent regulatory control. The research being addressed in the project will potentially reduce the environmental impacts of unconventional oil and gas production and enhance water sustainability at the energy-water nexus, particularly in regions where the fast-growing practice of hydraulic fracturing has imposed a considerable stress on the local fresh water resources. This project will provide excellent academic training and industry exposure opportunity for undergraduate students and two graduate students from Environmental Engineering and Chemistry through participation in a multidisciplinary team involving strong industry-university collaboration. The industrial partner will advise the research team on practical constraints and potential complications associated with alternative water treatment technologies, so that the PIs will formulate research strategies to address the unique water treatment needs of the energy industry, which are substantially different from water treatment for domestic use. The PIs will expand their current outreach programs to engage K-12 and community college students from under-represented groups in STEM curricula and research. Research data will be reported in public domain including conferences, industrial seminars, and peer-reviewed journals.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1701512","Cal","Cooper","cal.cooper@apachecorp.com","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Texas Tech University","Lubbock","794091035","8067423884","349 Administration Bldg","United States","Texas","TX","1440","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","1504","GRANT OPP FOR ACAD LIA W/INDUS","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Weile","Yan","weile.yan@ttu.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","1504",NA,NA,NA,"GRANT OPP FOR ACAD LIA W/INDUS",NA,"Michael","Findlater","michael.findlater@ttu.edu","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This award is to partially support the travel expenses of graduate students in attending the First International Workshop on Near Limit Flames, held at Boston University, July 29 to 30, 2017. This workshop is an important meeting on combustion science and engineering. Presentations in this conference represent the most updated research outcome in combustion flame at extreme conditions. The conference facilitates the exchange of combustion flame research results through plenary lectures and oral presentations. <br/><br/>Approximately 80% of energy conversion is accomplished by combustion, which is critically relevant to environmental sustainability. Modern combustion systems often operate at conditions that are near the flammability limit in order to achieve high efficiency. The extreme engine operating conditions and drastic change in fuels have significantly changed the flame regime and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to advance the fundamental understanding of near-limit flame dynamics. This workshop will discuss the recent progresses and challenges and to formulate future collaborations in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of near-limit flame dynamics. Understanding the near-limit flame dynamics is critical to control combustion processes and to design advanced combustion systems for clean energy and a sustainable environment.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1736346","Yiguang","Ju","yju@princeton.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

Molecular visualization, or the ability to understand three-dimensionality from two-dimensional representation, is a useful element in this building this understanding, yet few instructors teach or assess the skills needed to interpret two-dimensional images. This project will develop strategies and approaches to help students gain these important skills. In particular, the project will build a community of biochemistry and molecular biology educators who will help develop a set of competencies defining specific tasks that students will be expected to perform to develop their molecular visualization skills. Specifically, during the one-year term of this project, a series of national and regional workshops will be organized to develop a community of educators who are dedicated to the task of producing reliable and valid molecular visualization concept inventories. This group will develop a framework of goals and objectives for understanding four fundamental themes in molecular visualization - Monomer Recognition, Topology and Connectivity, Alternate Renderings, and Molecular Interactions. The group will also develop and populate a website with the competencies arising from the workshops.<br/><br/>This project will expand a framework established following an education symposium at the 2013 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology meeting to include competencies that will ultimately lead to constructing concept inventories in molecular visualization. This project will focus on four fundamental themes: Monomer Recognition, Topology and Connectivity, Alternate Renderings, and Molecular Interactions. Understanding these four themes will build a foundation that allows students to comprehend the structure-function relationship inherent in biomolecules. Regional workshops will bring together educators to identify and reach a consensus on competencies within these four themes. These competencies will be added to the molecular visualization framework housed at http://cbm.msoe.edu/crest/molviz/ for public use. This project has already begun to transform the way many biochemistry and molecular biology instructors use molecular representations in their classroom. For example, several instructors understand the need to assess their students' comprehension of the representations of a particular model before they used the model to draw higher level inferences (e.g. function). In articulating consensus-based learning goals and objectives and identifying competencies, this project will identify the foundations upon which concept inventories will be developed in future years. Importantly, this effort will be built around workshops that establish a community of practice for the explicit instruction of molecular visualization skills.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1712268","Henry","Jakubowski","hjakubowski@csbsju.edu","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Juniata College","Huntingdon","166522119","8146413000","1700 Moore Street","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1998","IUSE","8209","Improv Undergrad STEM Ed(IUSE)","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Daniel","Dries","dries@juniata.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Margaret","Franzen","franzen@msoe.edu","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They can result when new strains of a pathogen arise, or from a pathogen being introduced into a new area, and can threaten wildlife, livestock, and humans through illness and death. Because most emerging infectious diseases that shift to humans come from wildlife it is important to understand wildlife diseases. Often, scientists use mathematical models of disease as tools to understand existing patterns of how a disease spreads or to help predict future trends. This research focuses on understanding differences among hosts in how they behave, or how their bodies respond to infection affect the next step in a disease epidemic: when the pathogen spreads among hosts. This research will help scientists better understand how individual differences in what happens after infection should be incorporated into disease models. With this information, scientists and managers will be able to better design data collection and disease models for the targeted control of emerging infectious diseases. The project will also train a graduate student and result in the development of new teaching tools for grade school and undergraduate students, including a website that could be used at many other colleges and universities.<br/><br/><br/>Given the potential for severe consequences of emerging infections diseases with wildlife sources and the time and resource-intensive nature of gathering pathogen data in wildlife populations, improved disease models are necessary tools for providing insight into the research effort necessary to capture the transmission process. The objective of this research is to link empirical and modeling approaches to better understand how among-host variation in traits affects pathogen transmission in a wildlife system. It will integrate a theoretical model with empirical data from the host-pathogen system of house finches and their bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum. This work will address how the behavioral and physiological phenotypes affect disease dynamics and will also explore the effects of infection-induced behavioral changes. Experimental M. gallisepticum infection data combined with empirical contact network data will be used to parameterize a dynamic network disease model. This research will provide novel insights into the potential role of covariation between behavioral and immune competence in epidemic dynamics, and will serve as one of the first models to apply dynamic networks to an emerging infectious disease system in wildlife.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1701069","Meggan","Craft","craft@umn.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Minneapolis","554552070","6126245599","200 OAK ST SE","United States","Minnesota","MN","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lauren","White","whit1951@umn.edu","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Garrison","Intellectual Merit. How organisms respond to their physical and chemical and environment is a central question in marine ecology. For microbes living in the mesopelagic - the ocean's ""twilight zone"" - an efficient response is particularly important to capitalize on the intermittent delivery of organic and inorganic compounds sinking from the surface ocean. These organisms must have a suite of metabolic and regulatory strategies used to cope with environmental variability, but these strategies are largely unknown. Understanding when and why metabolic genes are expressed is critical to our understanding of nutrient remineralization in the ocean. Marine group 1 (MG1) archaea are ubiquitous, abundant microbes in the meso- and bathypelagic and promising model organisms for investigating these questions. MG1 archaea are chemolithoautotrophs that oxidize ammonia for energy and fix carbon for biomass, and as such, play a central role in the ocean's coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles. Though MG1 have historically eluded cultivation, recent efforts have been successful at bringing representative MG1 archaea from the open ocean into culture and demonstrating their importance in the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. This project takes advantage of unique MG1 cultures and the recently sequenced draft genome of one of the organisms - strain CN25 - to investigate the physiological and transcriptional responses of MG1 archaea to variations in their chemical environment, specifically:<br/>1. Comparative transcriptomics of CN25 cells grown under a range of energy availability and nitrosative stress will identify select genes that can be used to diagnose the physiological state of natural populations<br/>2. Improvements in the genomic and transcriptomic knowledge of MG1 archaea will facilitate a thorough reinterpretation of existing metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, as well as provide a better contextual understanding in future studies<br/>The investigators will conduct comparative transcriptomics of CN25 cells harvested in mid-exponential growth and stationary phase versus starved cells. Transcriptomes of cells grown at high nitrate concentrations and low pO2 with those grown in standard conditions will be characterized. A strand-specific, high-density RNAseq approach will be used to examine the expression of putative ORFs, polycistronic operons, and small RNAs, which, in addition to gene expression profiling, has the ancillary benefit of improving genome annotation. Finally, the investigators will sequence the genomes of two additional MG1 strains isolated from the open ocean, as well as single cells from environmental surveys, and leverage the combination with the CN25 genome to reanalyze available metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. The results will define the transcriptional response of a model mesopelagic microbe to a range of chemical environments, and show how the physicochemical environment induces changes in gene expression and gene content that result in greenhouse gas production. This work will rapidly generate new knowledge of how some of the most ubiquitous, yet heretofore elusive, microorganisms respond to geochemical variability and shape our evolving understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The scientific and societal impact of the project will be to elucidate the mechanisms of greenhouse gas production in a model marine organism that is of broad interest to biological and chemical oceanographers. Transcriptome sequencing will improve the assembly of the CN25 genome, the first genome of an MG1 archaeon from the open ocean. Both the genome and transcriptomes will be important references for researchers using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics in the ocean, as these techniques are reliant on a knowledgebase composed of both DNA sequence and physiology. Thus, the results add value to both existing and future studies. The proposed research will advance education, teaching, and training for the next generation of marine scientists by providing support for two early-career investigators, one postdoctoral researcher, and a secondary school teacher.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1739144","Alyson","Santoro","asantoro@ucsb.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Santa Barbara","Santa Barbara","931062050","8058934188","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","1650","BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","0000","UNASSIGNED","9117","MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The SB3C meetings, and their predecessor SBC meetings, are generally considered the premiere annual meetings for biomechanics. The primary purpose of the meeting is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and international scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanics, biotechnology, biotransport, biomaterials, tissue engineering, rehabilitation and design. The organizing committee for SB3C2016 is drawn from individuals in academia and the industry with significant experience in running the previous summer meetings. The meeting and its precursor meetings have traditionally provided a high-quality, multidisciplinary biomedical engineering event since the early 90's and contributed to training many generations of academics and researchers. Notably, the summer meetings series has, since its inception, prioritized the integration of students into the meeting to support their professional development and future connection to the biomechanics, biotransport and bioengineering research community. For many years, students have made up more than 50% of attendees and presenters. The theme of this year's meeting is ""Growth, Development, Remodeling, and Repair"". In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it serves an important cross-fertilization role, since attendees are drawn from a very broad range of disciplines beyond the biomechanics community. <br/><br/>The aims of the project are to sponsor travel fellowships for females and under-represented minorities; and, to sponsor the prestigious Student Paper Competition by covering the meeting registration costs of the top 40 BS and MS competition submissions. Finalists and winners in the student paper competition can add this information to their resumes, and the competition provides an opportunity for students to develop as researchers and is a significant career boost, enhancing retention of the most talented students and providing role models for all student attendees. Through the technical proceedings and conference web site, information presented at the meeting will be available to multiple societies and to the public at large. Further, the conference has historically had, and is expected to continue to have more than 50 percent of the attendees being students and postdoctoral fellows and more than 25 percent female attendees.

Rather the program is a shipboard educational experience that has offered high-quality academic programs to college, high-school, and graduate students, as well as K-12 teachers, for 45 years. The National Science Board recently named SEA the recipient of its 2016 Public Service Award for making a substantial contribution to increasing public understanding of science and engineering. NSF recognizes that many SEA alumni are professionals working and teaching in the marine sciences and related fields and for that reason have allowed for limited support through the Instrumentation Program. The panel considered this when it evaluated the requests and found that all items were adequately justified and important to the operations of SEA. The proposal was rated as Very Good. Nevertheless, in an uncertain budget year and without compelling NSF-funded work to call on, the Program will offer limited support for the proposal. Of the six requests, the Program will recommend the top two priorities. The remaining four should be submitted next year.<br/><br/>The Program recommends an award of $16,462 for the purchase of the following:<br/><br/>1) Deionized Lab Water System $7,445<br/>2) Two (2) Water Sampling Carousel Frames $9,017","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1723633","Paul","Joyce","pjoyce@sea.edu","04/10/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Sea Education Association","Woods Hole","025430006","5085403954","PO Box 6","United States","Massachusetts","MA","5413","OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Deborah","Goodwin","dgoodwin@sea.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rankins","Research Initiation Awards provide support for faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building a research program. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to North Carolina A&T State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project focuses on developing a mathematical model to understand the mechanisms underlying deep brain stimulation, a therapy used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Undergraduate students as well as high school students will gain research experiences. <br/><br/>The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease has been linked to the destruction of pathological rhythmicity in basal ganglia. To find a more effective deep brain stimulation procedure, it is crucial to use appropriate neuronal network models that are able to produce intermittently synchronized oscillatory dynamics observed in parkinsonian patients. As the only excitatory nucleus in the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in the dynamics of basal ganglia and is a standard target for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Recent experiments have identified a set of ionic currents that are responsible for various rhythmic bursting patterns in subthalamic nucleus neurons. This research will develop a new computational model for the subthalamic nucleus that comprises key currents and then set up network models, namely an updated basal ganglia network model and an extended cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus model. By performing numerical and mathematical analyses, the research will study how intrinsic neuronal properties and network properties in basal ganglia incorporate to generate intermittently synchronized rhythms. This project will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathological rhythms in parkinsonian basal ganglia and deep brain stimulation procedures. The research may also lead to the discovery of more effective methods to break the intermittently synchronized rhythms in parkinsonian states with a minimal amount of stimulation intervention.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1700199","Choongseok","Park","cpark@ncat.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University","Greensboro","274110001","3363347995","1601 E.

The technology will enable this on a parallel scale as well as the eventual applicability to T cell immunotherapy. The ability to target and profile specific genes and pathways in single cells with a nanoneedle-based microrobotic device will constitute a major technological advance that will enable researchers to monitor cancer progression, study the- underlying mechanisms and develop therapeutic T cell engineering. The technology is primarily addressing a fundamental problem associated with cell and gene therapy: viruses used to program cells before transplant into the body provoke undesirable immune response, may cause adverse effects as viral DNA integrates into the human genome, involve costly production and lengthy protocols, and can typically only be used once. This technology will enable an alternative engineering solution to this fundamental therapeutic problem which can eliminate such toxicity issues encompassing major applications in other areas including livestock, industrial biology, agriculture, drug discovery and development.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will further develop a technology that allows editing of single T cells with high transduction efficiency and minimal invasiveness. Parameters such as target efficiency, sensitivity/specificity of manipulation and delivery, device functionality after repetitive transduction, uniformity of manipulation across different single cells, as well as precision, reproducibility, hysteresis and stability of the motion of the microrobotic actuator will be optimized. The silicon-based microrobotic actuator is designed such that it can accurately track and target desired positions within single cells under an open loop control without a position feedback sensor, thus avoiding complicated control system electronics. A platform has been developed that includes a microrobotic actuator, which consists of a microstage driven by capacitive components that moves in 3D using an electrostatic field responsible for the independent motion to the nanoneedles. The key innovative concept here is to integrate the parallel architecture based 3D actuator technology with multiple nanoneedle biosensors so that each of them can be independently moved for targeted single-cell manipulation.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1740927","Rhonda","Shrader","Rhonda_shrader@berkeley.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This I-Corps team has developed a unique high resolution weather forecasting model using a high-performance computer framework that employed all available local weather observations and state-of-the-art local doppler radar data to improve local precipitation forecasts on a short-term basis. In conjunction with precipitation forecasts, our system will support water resources related decision-making. A web-based service to provide these pinpoint rainfall forecasts and other related hydrological data products will be available. Operations managers of businesses and government agencies (i.e., water districts, agricultural farms, insurance companies, energy companies) who rely on very accurate and precise rainfall forecasts to make economic-based decisions will be able to have quick access to customized rainfall forecasts and hydrological products at their user-defined locations. During short-term hydrological extremes, these pinpoint accurate rainfall forecasts and products will improve the efficiency and decision-making abilities within the companies and agencies themselves, and it will help them to better communicate their decisions to their end-users and the public.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will employ a high-resolution weather forecasting model. It can have a horizontal resolution of 1 km or finer and uses specific 3D-Variational data assimilation methods which incorporate all available real-time weather observations from multiple sources. These input sources include satellite data (e.g., GOES-R), weather station and rain gauge data, quantitative precipitation estimates from local doppler radars, and other global and regional forecasting models (e.g., NOAA?s High Resolution Rapid Refresh and North American Model). The model can be executed separately for any specific region and location of interest to the end-user, can extract pinpoint rainfall forecasts, and can be updated every 3 or 6 hours depending on the circumstance. Other hydrological products available from the project that can also assist in decision support such as drought conditions (e.g., soil moisture and drought severity indices) and water levels of local reservoirs.

If unmanaged, PEVs would represent major extra loads for utilities, which would increase energy peak consumption and require considerable investment to upgrade grid infrastructure. The technology developed here involves a smart charging software, which will enable real time communication between PEV fleets and utilities, and will remotely control PEV charging to provide grid regulation services. This project will bridge the gap between the automotive industry and the energy industry, and will develop strategies to create a smart and connected ecosystem around PEV charging. Successful commercialization of the smart charging software could result in lower PEV cost of ownership, and increased penetration of clean transportation in the US.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on an advanced, adaptive, optimization framework for Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging control in power networks. The technique can control PEV charging under conditions of general uncertainty, and consider both driver mobility constraints and power network constraints. The optimization framework is particularly adapted to large fleets of PEVs and shows fast convergence rate and privacy preserving properties. The method uses past PEV data to predict travel behaviors and energy demand. It also models distribution grid constraints and electricity market structure to set relevant optimization objectives. The method utilizes a range of optimization methods and selects the best algorithm based on tradeoff between optimality, constraint satisfaction and computation time. The methods include partial differential equation aggregation techniques for car sharing fleets, plug-and-play model predictive control for power networks with high congestion, and dual-splitting methods for large scale residential fleets with lower computation capabilities.","04/10/2017","04/10/2017","1740384","Rhonda","Shrader","Rhonda_shrader@berkeley.edu","04/10/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lutz","In this project, the PIs propose a new set of tools useful to detect and measure the importance of market power in industries. This question is central to many economic problems. It is particularly relevant for a vast array of antitrust questions ranging from the approval of mergers to the detection of price fixing cases, as well as to help guide regulatory institutions in markets such as financial services, energy, and telecommunication. In most of these cases, measuring market power hinges on two key elements: (i) identification of the degree of substitution between products, and (ii) quantification of its impact on market prices. The key contribution of the proposed work to this literature is that it will provide a new set of empirical techniques to both measure degree of substitutability between products, and help better identify firms' pricing conduct in differentiated product industries.<br/><br/>On the first point, the PIs build on an important literature in the field of Industrial Organization, devoted to the identification of substitution patterns in markets for differentiated products. The main contribution of this work is to show the existence of a source of variation in the data that drives the identification of the degree of substitutability between products in standard demand models. They exploit this variation to construct parametric and non-parametric estimators of models commonly used in the literature (e.g. Berry et al. (1995), Nevo (2001)). This addresses important reserves raised by practitioners regarding the robustness of the predictions offered by existing methods (e.g. Angrist and Pischke (2010)). On the second point, the PIs propose a novel approach to empirically estimate the supply relationship between prices and demand factors, without imposing strong and often untested assumptions. Early efforts to identify firms' conduct have relied on contrasting observed measures of pass-through of demand or cost shocks on prices and quantities, with fairly general theoretical predictions from models of competition or collusion (Bresnahan, 1989). This empirical strategy can bound the degree of market power in homogenous good industries, but cannot easily be extended to settings in which sellers supply differentiated goods and services. In contrast, researchers studying the extent of market power in differentiated product industries typically rely on more restrictive models of competition, which often eliminates entirely the possibility of testing for alternative conduct assumptions; such as perfect competition or collusion. To get around this problem the PIs generalize Bresnahan's (1987) strategy for testing for the presence of coordinated pricing to an environment with potentially rich product differentiation, allowing for a larger class of possible supply relations to determine firm conduct. This allows in turn to directly examine how firms exploit market power when setting prices, rather than assuming it in the form of stylized game theoretic models.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1737753","Amit Kumar","Gandhi","agandhi@ssc.wisc.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","National Bureau of Economic Research Inc","Cambridge","021385398","6178683900","1050 Massachusetts Avenue","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1320","ECONOMICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The key task of liposomes (storage and delivery to targets) requires them to be flexible enough to merge with target membranes in order to deliver their cargos, and yet to have sufficient structural stability to maintain integrity without rupturing and losing the stored material in the naturally dynamic biological environments. Therefore, understanding the mechanics of liposomes is of great interest to both fundamental and applied scientists who are developing artificial, biomimetic liposomes as targeted drug/gene delivery systems for better therapeutics. A major challenge however, is the lack of efficient engineering tools to probe the mechanical flexibility of the sub-cellular, nanoscale liposomes. The research addresses this need by developing a novel method based on nanopore technology that uses electric fields to deform liposomes and electrical measurements to characterize their shape. The overall goal is to characterize the mechanical flexibility of nano-liposomes with the ultimate goal to establish a method to study mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as viruses and other biological samples at cellular/molecular level.<br/><br/>This project will advance the engineering tools for mechanical characterization of soft biological materials at the micro/nanoscale. The technology uses nanopore resistive pulse sensing to detect membrane deformation. As liposomes translocate through a nanopore, they experience strong electric stresses and physical confinement, which cause deformation. In this project, liposome shapes will be inferred from ionic current blockade, i.e., the sharp change (pulse) in ohmic resistance when a liposome is present in the pore. A theoretical model for liposome deformation in the nanopore will be developed to yield membrane mechanical properties. The method will enable both high-throughput and single-particle resolution because (1) thousands of liposomes pass through the nanopore and a resistive pulse will be recorded for each individual one, and (2) thousands of measurements on a single liposome can be made by alternating the applied electric field direction to drive back-and-forth translocation. In broader terms, this method will enable studying mechanobiology at novel unprecedented scales, which is single-virus and single-particle level.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1740011","Petia","Vlahovska","petia.vlahovska@northwestern.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","7479","Biomechanics & Mechanobiology","024E","MATERIALS DESIGN","028E","BIOMECHANICS","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Today, over 56 million people in the United States report some degree of disability, a number which will likely grow in coming years as the so-called ""baby boomer"" generation ages. RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in both non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology. The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field. Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers. It encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers as well as participants in previous SDCs, many of whom are now leaders in service, research, and education related to technology for persons with disabilities. Furthermore, continuing a practice started a few years ago, all participants (not just the finalists) will create blog posts that capture and archive their submissions, and these will remain accessible indefinitely through the RESNA website and the AT Wiki. Thus, educators will be able to share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done, while service providers and persons with disabilities will be able to search for unique solutions to barriers they may face. More information about RESNA and its annual conference is available online at http://www.resna.org while information specific to the SDC may be found at http://aac-rerc.psu.edu/wordpressmu/RESNA-SDC and student team entry abstracts are included on the AT Wiki http://atwiki.assistivetech.net/index.php/ATWiki_Home.<br/><br/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference; since then over 265 designs have been identified as winning entries from among over 850 submitted by students from over 125 different universities and institutes of higher learning. Both undergraduate and master's level graduate candidates are eligible to submit entries, which must represent the work of students only; no faculty or professionals may be included as co-authors, although faculty may be mentioned as advisors and/or mentors. NSF has been a supporter since 2005. This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools. A team of 5 judges will pre-select at least 6 semi-finalist teams, from each of which two members will be invited to attend the conference fully supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration. At the beginning of the conference these teams will make presentations and show off their working prototypes to the judges before a public audience during a platform session on Wednesday, June 28, where 5 finalist teams will be selected. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. In addition, finalists will have an opportunity to present their projects during the Annual Developers' Forum later that evening, which highlights new products under development (some past SDC student team designs have been patented and are now available commercially).","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1738920","Michael","Brogioli","mbrogioli@resna.org","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Tech Society of NA","Arlington","222091903","7035246686","1700 North Moore Street","United States","Virginia","VA","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Generally speaking, geometric analysis involves using analytic methods to solve problems in differential geometry and general relativity. This workshop will bring together mathematicians, including top experts in the field, to communicate recent progress and to promote interaction and collaboration among the participants. In particular, the goals of the conference are to disseminate new advances in geometric analysis, to contribute to the training of graduate students, and to bring a large group of mathematicians to exchange and to incubate new mathematical ideas. To realize these goals, junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) and researchers from various under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply and will be given priority for financial support from the organizing committee.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring leading experts from all over the world to present the new results and/or surveys of current progresses in geometric analysis, in particular, from the following subfields: (1) Analysis of geometric PDE including curvature flows (e.g., power of Gauss curvature flow, Ricci flow, gradient Ricci solitons, and manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound); (2) Kahler-Einstein metrics and the Kahler-Ricci flow (e.g., singular Kahler metrics, the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kahler manifolds, the regularity and weak solutions of Kahler-Ricci flow, and Kahler-Ricci solitons); (3) Minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flow (e.g., special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry, min-max theory from the proof of Willmore conjecture, and the formation of singularities of mean curvature flow); and (4) Mathematical general relativity (e.g., space-like hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, the center of mass, and the nonlinear gluing approach). Since 2010 PIMS Workshop on Geometric Analysis, there are many exciting new results and new techniques in these fields, and the conference will have about 25 speakers discussing these advances.

Unfortunately, these small grain sizes are energetically unfavorable as compared to larger sized grains. Upon heating, the smaller grains will grow to reduce this energy difference which results in the loss of strength. In recent years, the development of specific types of alloys has shown that the lower concentration atom type, or solute, can stabilize these grains against this growth. An outcome of these observations has been various models to explain the grain size stabilization. However, these models have several fundamental scientific gaps that still remain to be solved. For example, the modeled grain boundaries are considered equivalent wherein reality grain boundaries are diverse in their structure, energy, and mobility. The lack of experimental verification of this solute specific segregation to grain boundaries has hindered further model development. This research will overcome these prior limitations by combining electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to detect solute segregation to those specific boundaries. These results will then be forward fed to atomics models that explain this diversity of behavior. This research will be integrated into various outreach activities, including a summer materials camp for secondary education teachers to introduce materials science into the middle/high school classrooms. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>Nano-crystalline materials is an area of active research owing to their unique size dependent properties. Since interfaces (boundaries) constitute a large fraction of the entire structure, the corresponding interfacial energy from those boundaries can make these grains inherently unstable. Solute partitioning to these boundaries has been devised as a means to stabilize these grains against growth with concepts of kinetic solute drag effects and thermodynamic reduction of interfacial energy being suggested mechanisms for stabilization. To date, these models assume all the grain boundaries are isotropic and equivalent to each other; in reality grain boundaries are diverse in energy, structure, and mobility with solute partitioning being a function of that variability. Using cross-correlative precession electron diffraction and atom probe tomography, this research will elucidate the solute specificity to grain boundaries that leads to stabilization. The experimental findings will be linked to hydride Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics atomistic models that will elucidate the mechanisms of stabilization to specific boundary types. In addition, real-time experimental quantification of those boundaries during annealing will be measured to ascertain mobility and kinetic contributors to stability. The collective results will bridge outstanding and fundamental knowledge gaps in revealing how thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for specific grain boundaries leads to grain size stability. This research will be seamlessly integrated to various outreach activities to strengthen the STEM disciplines including a summer materials camp for secondary education teachers to introduce materials science into middle/high school classrooms.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1709803","Gregory","Thompson","gthompson@eng.ua.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Alabama Tuscaloosa","Tuscaloosa","354870005","2053485152","801 University Blvd.","United States","Alabama","AL","1771","METAL & METALLIC NANOSTRUCTURE","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, for economic reasons, it is critical to use these resources as efficiently as possible. Increasing a power plant's operating temperature increases its efficiency. The limiting factor for higher temperature is materials that can operate at higher temperatures, and are economically viable. The aim of this project is to elucidate the deformation mechanisms in alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels that are being considered for this application. The work will train both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in state of the art techniques.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project will ascertain the deformation mechanisms associated with grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening, and attempt to understand the fundamental deformation behavior in alloys containing both a precipitate free zone (PFZ) and multiple types of precipitates in both the GBs and the matrix each of which can contribute differently to the deformation behavior. The work will be performed on the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al. Detailed microstructural and defect characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) wlll be performed before and after mechanical testing. TEM in-situ straining and SEM in-situ straining studies performed at both room temperature and 750C will examine both dislocation/precipitate and dislocation/GB interactions, including understanding the role of the PFZ along the GBs.

The conference will bring together experts in geometric group theory, computability theory and computer science to discuss recent developments and interactions between these subjects, and to create a roadmap for future cooperation. The junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students attending the conference will benefit from interacting with senior researchers in several disciplines and establishing valuable professional connections and collaborations. In addition to the regular scientific program, the conference will feature a presentation and a discussion on Wikipedia editing in Mathematics, including a practical how-to guide and demonstration.<br/><br/>Interaction with computation permeated the development of geometric group theory, from the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s, through the work of Turing in 1930s, the Novikov-Boone Theorem in the 1950s and the theory of word-hyperbolic and automatic groups in the 1990s, to the present day. Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1719710","Robert","Gilman","rgilman@stevens.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Stevens Institute of Technology","HOBOKEN","070305991","2012168762","CASTLE POINT ON HUDSON","United States","New Jersey","NJ","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ilya","Kapovich","kapovich@math.uiuc.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","1265","1268",NA,NA,"GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS","FOUNDATIONS","Alexei","Miasnikov","amiasnik@stevens.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the last five years, a new class of nano materials called gradient nanostructured metals have emerged as a material class which exhibits an unusual combination of ultrahigh strength, good tensile ductility, enhanced strain hardening, superior fracture toughness and fatigue resistance. However, the current lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the properties of these materials severely limits our ability to tailor or optimize their properties for specific applications. On the other hand, recent advances in computational modeling and simulation capabilities are providing unprecedented opportunities to advance the knowledge frontier in our understanding of mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nano-scales. The proposed research will take advantage of the cutting-edge multiscale modeling and simulation methods to address the fundamental issues with regard to the mechanical properties and behavior of gradient nanostructured metals. <br/>The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art computational techniques. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The proposed research will address the following questions: What are the deformation mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of gradient nanostructured metals? How to design the gradient micro- and nanostructures to optimize the mechanical responses of gradient nanostructured metals? The problems under study will be tackled via a multiscale modeling approach that combines finite element method, strain gradient plasticity, cohesive modeling, crystal plasticity, dislocation dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations will be used to investigate the deformation and failure mechanisms of gradient nanostructured metals. The technical approach will be based on the experience and theoretical/simulation capabilities developed by the PI. The proposed work will clarify the controlling deformation mechanisms through ultra-large-scale and high-resolution atomistic and dislocation dynamics simulations, interpret the experimental data and phenomena through continuum strain gradient plasticity and cohesive modeling of fatigue and fracture behavior, and guide further research in structural optimization and processing. The ultra-large scale simulations in the proposed work will be performed on the National Institute for Computational Sciences, and the rest of the proposed computational work will be performed at the Center for Computing and Visualization at Brown University.

Algebra is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, whereas model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades logic has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering. For about fifteen years, the PI has been involved in a collaborative effort to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis. These investigations are naturally related to other fields within mathematics (mainly logic and analysis) but may also lead to novel applications of differential equations in science and engineering. They recently led to some decisive positive results, and many questions which seemed out of reach previously may now be answerable.<br/><br/>More concretely, the goal of this project is to unify three seemingly very different approaches to enrich the real continuum by infinitesimal and infinite quantities: surreal numbers, germs of real-valued functions, and transseries. Surreal numbers have a combinatorial flavor and encompass Cantor's ordinal numbers; they were introduced by J. H. Conway in the 1970s in connection with game theory. Germs of real-valued functions are central objects in analysis; they were first systematically studied by P. du Bois-Reymond in the 1870s. Transseries are formal objects that model the growth rates of such germs at infinity; they arose in both analysis and logic during the 1980s. Their formal nature also makes transseries suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems. The goal of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of these structures, and to establish links between them. For example, we would like to know: Are there analytic structures (Hardy fields) with the same logical features as transseries? Is there a natural isomorphism between surreals and transseries? Answers to questions such as these may now be within grasp due to fundamental advances in our understanding of the ideas of number, series, and function within the last decade, and would exhibit heretofore unknown relationships between them.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1700439","Matthias","Aschenbrenner","matthias@math.ucla.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES","900951406","3107940102","10889 Wilshire Boulevard","United States","California","CA","1268","FOUNDATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The emphasis is on enumerative and random aspects in the topology of real algebraic varieties. The main goal of the meeting is to facilitate discussions and collaborations in a focused setting, between researchers mostly in Northern America but also in France. The small size of the workshop provides an ideal environment for graduate students and young researchers to interact with experts in the field. <br/><br/>The field of real algebraic geometry, and in particular the study of the topology of real algebraic varieties, employs a wide variety of techniques, ranging from symplectic geometry, tropical geometry, as well as more traditional tools such as complex algebraic geometry, topology of manifolds and transformation groups.

This workshop brings together researchers from many of these areas, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its participants. In particular, the presentations will be devoted to the recent progress in the enumerative geometry of real algebraic varieties (Georgieva, Niu, Tukachinsky), a probabilistic approach to real enumerative geometry (Basu, Lundberg) and to new directions in the study of real algebraic manifolds (Gabrielov, Sottile).<br/><br/>For more details, see the webpage of the workshop: https://my.vanderbilt.edu/ragworkshop/ .","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1711567","Ioana","Suvaina","ioana.suvaina@vanderbilt.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Vanderbilt University","Nashville","372350002","6153222631","Sponsored Programs Administratio","United States","Tennessee","TN","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rares","Rasdeaconu","rares.rasdeaconu@vanderbilt.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","1267",NA,NA,NA,"TOPOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Magnesium (Mg) is nearly four times lighter than steel and its ultra-low density and high specific strength make Mg alloys attractive lightweighting materials for commercial and defense platforms. However, the use of Mg has been inhibited by its limited ductility and formability, which is attributed to strong plastic anisotropy that results from its hexagonal crystal structure. Recent gains in formability have been achieved through rare earth alloying, and this project will provide a detailed understanding of the influence that these rare earth elements have on the atomic-scale mechanisms that govern ductility and formability. The insights obtained from this experimental study will accelerate alloy development and help promote cost-effective lightweighting in a wide variety of automotive, military and aerospace applications.

The conventional experimental probes used to characterize these systems typically do not explore techniques that are either sensitive to the atomic species or that are performed in situ. It is imperative, therefore, to identify new experimental probes that can provide crucial information on NCs that cannot be achieved via other methods. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, employs state-of-the-art x-ray characterization methods to elucidate a wide range of unanswered problems in the NC literature, including the mechanism of cation exchange in NCs and effects of ligand chemistry on charge carrier dynamics in NCs. The project focuses on both operando/in situ soft and hard x-ray absorption spectroscopy and well as ultra-fast x-ray absorption spectroscopy. These techniques, for the most part, have not been exploited to probe the chemistry and physics of semiconductor NCs and it is anticipated that they will provide crucial insight to answer important questions regarding the bonding and charge transfer dynamics in these materials.

Unfortunately, as the dimensions of ferroelectric materials decrease to a few tens of nanometers, their high dielectric property eventually disappears as a result of destabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop novel, high dielectric constant ferroelectric nanocrystals with stable ferroelectric phase and nanosized domains. The understanding of polymer defect-induced ferroelectric nanodomains within inorganic nanocrystals paves the way to create many other intriguing ferroelectric nanocrystals. Meanwhile, the research project is integrated with nanoscience education through close interactions among graduate students, undergraduate students, high school science teachers, and high school students in a multilevel learning experience inspired by the excitement of discovery at both Georgia Tech and Case Western Reserve University. The goals are to stimulate the interest of high school students in the area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and better prepare undergraduate students for the STEM-related professions. To enhance the public awareness of nanoscience and nanotechnology, research findings are widely disseminated to multiple constituencies through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This proposal aims to understand the effect of organic/inorganic hybridization on the nanoscopic ferroelectric phase and domain structures in polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals, and extend the underlying mechanism to other lead-free relaxor ferroelectric systems to achieve high dielectric constants for various potential electrical applications. First, novel amphiphilic nonlinear block copolymers are rationally designed and synthesized. Subsequently, uniform polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals with precisely tailored dimensions are crafted by employing amphiphilic nonlinear block copolymers as nanoreactors. The nanoscale ferroelectric phase and domain structures in polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals are interrogated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the mechanism of their relaxor ferroelectric behavior can be unraveled. Finally, the underlying mechanism are extended to create other lead-free relaxor ferroelectric nanocrystals with even higher dielectric constants.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1709420","Lei","Zhu","lei.zhu2@case.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","1762","SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS","7234","SENSORS NON-SOLICITATION RESEA","7237","NANO NON-SOLIC SCI & ENG AWD","8248","SusChEM","8249","Sustainable Materials","8614","Nanomaterials",NA,NA,"Zhiqun","Lin","zhiqun.lin@mse.gatech.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Swanberg","The warming Arctic is reshaping the tundra landscape as ground-ice that is thousands of years old thaws, resulting in differential ground settlement that alters the distribution of water and snow in a region with desert-like precipitation. Field measurements across the Arctic have documented long-term and gradual warming of permafrost and recently the observations have also included rapid ice-wedge degradation in response to a single and unusually warm summer. The goal of this project is to understand the complex and interlinked processes responsible for the evolution of the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon tundra landscape by combining field measurements from nine Canadian, Russian, and Alaskan field sites, numerical modeling, and very high spatial resolution optical imagery that has recently become available for the entire Arctic tundra domain. <br/><br/>A combination of detailed imagery and advanced processing algorithms will allow pan-Arctic mapping of ice-wedge polygon extent and types (low- and high-centered). A map of that extent and detail does not yet exisxt, but is necessary to link carbon, water, and energy processes occurring at the ice-wedge polygon scale to the larger Arctic land-ocean-atmosphere system. Currently, permafrost thaw and subsequent carbon release is, at best, described in global models via gradual increases in active layer thickness, while field observations clearly show additional dramatic changes to the tundra ecosystem due to rapid differential ground subsidence as ice-wedges melt. A low-centered polygon landscape, which evolved over several thousand years via the slow process of ice-wedge growth, can harbor a sea of shallow ponds throughout the summer that supports a myriad of migratory birds during the breeding season. In just two years, the scene could change dramatically with exposed dry mounds where the shallow water bodies once were, while the surface water area can shrink into narrow elongated beads of deeper ponds above the melted ice-wedges. A complicated set of sub-polygon to watershed scale responses will determine the fate of the landscape. These mechanisms, part of the soil-vegetation-water continuum, will be defined via a numerical biogeophysical model informed by field measurements and repeat imagery of ice-wedge evolution. The new knowledge will support the research community in refining the role of the Arctic in the global climate system. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include training of the new generation of Arctic researchers by supporting a graduate student, a post-doctoral fellow, and an early-career scientist.

Topology and geometry are central areas of mathematics that have been the focus of active research for centuries. Topology concerns the mathematical properties of spaces ranging from the physical, like the surface of a doughnut, to the abstract, like the space of configurations of robots in a factory or the space of functions that satisfy a differential equation. Geometry concerns abstract or concrete notions distance or length, such as the amount of energy to move between two configurations of robots. Topology and geometry enjoy particularly rich interactions in low dimensions, and these connections have been a source of profound discoveries in both fields. The main objective of the conference is to bring together leading experts who have made substantial contributions in low-dimensional topology and geometry and to provide a platform to present recent results and propose future directions of research. The conference is organized in conjunction with the 32nd Shanks Lecture, which will be delivered by Professor Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley). This award provides opportunities for mathematicians from underrepresented groups and researchers that are early in their career or lack other sources of travel support to attend and participate in the conference.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on important developments in low-dimensional topology and geometry, with emphasis on the powerful negative curvature and combinatorial techniques that have driven many recent advances. Topics will include, but are not limited to, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, mapping class groups, the geometry and topology of curves on surfaces, surface bundles, Gromov-hyperbolic simplicial complexes, and CAT(0) cube complexes. The activities will include nineteen keynote talks and the Shanks lecture, with ample time for questions and discussion. The combination of topics and speakers will attract numerous participants and will afford students and recent PhDs an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from leaders in these fields.

If analyzed properly, these data can expand our knowledge and improve contemporary healthcare services from diagnosis to prevention to personalized treatment, and can also provide insights into reducing healthcare costs. However, biomedical data can be rather big and complex, and are often characterized by some mixture of high dimensionality, heterogeneity, high volume, high velocity, and high variety. Advances in biomedical big data analysis can greatly impact the development of biomedical sciences.<br/><br/>This workshop will bring together some of the most prominent statisticians in biomedical big data and a selected group of local biomedical researchers in a collaborative setting to discuss and foster cutting-edge developments of statistical theory, methods, and tools for biomedical big data analysis. The format of this workshop is designed to foster interactions between statisticians and biomedical researchers. To facilitate communications between graduate students, junior researchers, and senior researchers, a poster session is included in the program. To disseminate the results of the meeting, the program and abstracts will be widely circulated, and modest travel funds for a large geographically diverse group of graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty are planned.

Over the past 26 years, the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP alliance has demonstrated unparalleled success in recruiting, retaining, and graduating bachelors' STEM degrees from currently underrepresented populations. The Bridge to Doctorate: WAESO LSAMP, Multidisciplinary STEM Solutions 2017-2019 will expand efforts to recruit, admit, enroll, graduate with thesis masters degrees, and fully prepare for admission to highly reputable doctoral programs 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students. This new cohort of 12 students will receive specialized attention as a group by faculty and staff while engaging in peer mentoring, challenging research and academic study opportunities and activities while receiving intensive support from their mentors. <br/><br/>This project will utilize a framework derived from elements of the evidence based research literature and MTBI's 21-year model of mentorship that have focused on the study of the underlying factors, forces and methods that have led to the graduation of URM alumni earning PhDs predominantly in the mathematical sciences since 2005. Some of these factors include: improving a URM student's research self-efficacy, research experience, personalized training for fellowship applications, PhD program applications, and manuscript writing and mentoring to increase student self-confidence and increase the likelihood that a student will pursue a PhD in a STEM field. BD students will be immersed in the existing academic community and inclusive national and local (ASU) communities via regularly scheduled professional development workshops and community building social events to decrease attrition and increase experience in utilizing research tools and specific disciplinary skills. BD students will be paired with mentors and peers via the academically stimulating MTBI community, a community that promotes scientific immersion and intellectual fusion year round.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1702083","Antonio","Garcia","tony.garcia@asu.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Arizona State University","TEMPE","852816011","4809655479","ORSPA","United States","Arizona","AZ","9133","ALLIANCES-MINORITY PARTICIPAT.","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Carlos","Castillo-Chavez","ccchavez@asu.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The area of sensor networks, and cloud and edge computing has contributed significantly to the development of IoT. However, IoT presents a more challenging environment as compared to edge computing and sensor networks: Specially challenging is the deployment of mission-critical applications - applications whose performance may deeply impact business/organization operations. The goal of this proposal is to develop techniques to deploy mission critical applications with stringent requirements in IoT environments. <br/>This proposal will address the problem of deploying mission-critical systems by focusing on the following tasks: (a) The first thrust will be development of techniques to customize deployments to meet the needs of specific applications. One would like to design the IoT software base to be generic so that it can be used by a wide range of applications. However, generic software may not be suitable to to meet the requirements of mission critical applications. This may force the designers to manually develop services specialized for specific applications. The project will develop techniques that can automatically optimize generic software to obtain customized versions to meet the needs of specific applications. (b) The second thrust is the development of compositional techniques that will systematically exploit commonalities between the applications. As there may be multiple applications that share the underlying resources, exploiting such commonalities will be essential to meet stringent performance requirements. Extensive performance evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the performance of implementations generated by the proposed techniques with respect to manually developed implementations.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1720579","Gurdip","Singh","gsingh06@syr.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Syracuse University","SYRACUSE","132441200","3154432807","OFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS","United States","New York","NY","7798","SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","7916","EAGER","7942","HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kimbrel","Concepts and methodologies from economics and social sciences have found numerous applications in the study of the Internet and e-commerce. At the core of many such applications lies the notion of equilibria, which has been widely studied by game theorists and economists to model and predict the strategic behavior of selfish yet rational agents. During the past decade, the computation of equilibria in both games and markets has been studied intensively and many of the exciting developments have brought new insights towards a much better understanding of equilibria. At the same time, they opened up a window to many new research challenges. The goal of the project is to explore some of the important directions and problems that have emerged in the new frontiers of equilibrium computation. Research along directions pursued in the project will complement the already extensive literature in economics and social sciences on equilibria, by offering new perspectives through the lens of algorithms, approximation, and computational complexity. In addition to curriculum development, mentoring PhD students, and involving undergraduate students in accessible projects, the PIs will actively pursue outreach activities and broadly disseminate results obtained in the project.<br/><br/>Some of the research directions that the PIs plan to explore include the following: 1) Deepen our understanding of the new exponential-time hypothesis for fixed-point computation employed by Rubinstein in his recent breakthrough, by exploring its connections with other natural conjectures on the exact complexity of fundamental equilibrium computation problems. 2) Explore connections between two problems that have been studied intensively in the literature, the problem of finding an approximate Nash equilibrium in an anonymous game with a polynomial precision and that in a two-player game with a constant precision. 3) Study the computation of equilibria in games and markets with a unique equilibrium. Equilibrium as a prediction tool is more meaningful when a unique equilibrium exists. 4) Work towards a dichotomy theorem for Arrow-Debreu market equilibria that aims to classify every family of utilities into those that are easy to solve and those that are intractable.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1703925","Mihalis","Yannakakis","mihalis@cs.columbia.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Columbia University","NEW YORK","100276902","2128546851","2960 Broadway","United States","New York","NY","7796","ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS","7924","MEDIUM PROJECT","7932","COMPUT GAME THEORY & ECON","7927","COMPLEXITY & CRYPTOGRAPHY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xi","Chen","xc2198@columbia.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

More often than not, physical and bio-geochemical phenomena on one scale (e.g., a pore scale) affect, and are coupled to phenomena on a vastly different scale (e.g., a field scale). Such phenomena defy coarse-scale continuum descriptions, since they exhibit high localization (e.g., propagation of reactive fronts and biofilm growth) and/or strong nonlinear coupling between the processes involved (e.g., dynamic changes in porosity and permeability due to dissolution or precipitation). Hybrid numerical algorithms are to be used when coarse-scale continuum models fail to accurately describe a physical phenomenon in a small part of a computational domain. Accurate and efficient coupling of two (or more) models operating on vastly different spatial and/or temporal scales in a hybrid remains a major theoretical and computational challenge. A key to the success of a hybrid method is an efficient implementation of coupling conditions on the interface between its constitutive models. Additionally, uncertainty about pore geometry undermines the veracity of pore-scale simulations and, hence, of hybrid simulations of which they are a constitutive part. Overreaching goals of the proposed activity are to establish a theoretical foundation for hybrid modeling of subsurface flow and transport, to develop corresponding numerical algorithms, and to provide computational tools for robust uncertainty quantification in hybrid models. To achieve these goals, the investigators will develop hybrid algorithms for reactive flows in fractured and porous media, quantify uncertainty in pore-scale geometry in hybrid simulations, and experimentally validate hybrid simulations.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this proposal will enhance sustainability of essential water resources. Groundwater is a principal source of domestic water supply in the United States, and it is a major source of fresh water for industrial, agricultural and public uses. By establishing a novel modeling framework, this proposal will provide a scientific basis for reliable predictions of impacts of land use change and climate change, and more accurate assessments of groundwater contamination risks. The methods and algorithms developed in the course of the proposed activity will lay a solid foundation for improved quantitative understanding of subsurface processes with tightly coupled pore- and field-scales. The proposal will support the efforts of graduate students. The investigators will actively promote STEM career paths of underrepresented groups, and establish an outreach K-12 program dedicated to providing an intensive college prep education for motivated low-income students.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1742569","Ilenia","Battiato","ibattiat@stanford.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","1579","HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9150",NA,NA,NA,"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When that right is violated, anonymity-preserving technologies can provide a safety net. Anonymity-preserving systems are specifically designed to prevent adversaries from linking users to their actions within the system; most online services today are not designed to protect anonymity.<br/><br/>This project studies the anonymity properties of networked systems in which users broadcast sensitive information over a network. It considers two representative applications: anonymous microblogging and cryptocurrencies. Anonymous microblogging refers to social networks where users broadcast messages over a social graph; examples include Yik Yak and Whisper. Cryptocurrencies are distributed, digital currencies that allow a community to collectively, cryptographically verify the legitimacy of transactions; Bitcoin is the most successful example. Both anonymous microblogging platforms and cryptocurrencies broadcast sensitive messages over a network and are generally perceived as systems that protect user anonymity. This project aims to understand, from first principles, the vulnerabilities of existing broadcasting protocols against statistical deanonymization attacks, and whether such attacks can be prevented by carefully designing new protocols. Additionally, the project will develop open-source implementations to demonstrate the key theory including a distributed anonymous messaging application and a lightweight upgrade to Bitcoin's networking stack. The project also includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in this important research area.<br/><br/>The project is conducted in three steps. The first step is model-building which extracts simple, canonical mathematical models that capture the essence of these complex systems. The second step is source detection, where an adversary performing statistical inference to deanonymize the source of a broadcast is considered, and the mathematical models from step 1 are used to analyze the vulnerability of current protocols. The final step focuses on source hiding where the aim is to design novel broadcasting and network-management protocols that give provably-optimal anonymity guarantees while maintaining high utility for the target applications.","04/11/2017","04/11/2017","1705007","Pramod","Viswanath","pramodv@uiuc.edu","04/11/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","7797","COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS","7924","MEDIUM PROJECT","7935","COMM & INFORMATION THEORY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sewoong","Oh","swoh@illinois.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Giulia","Fanti","fanti@illinois.edu","04/11/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since 1992 ICASS has brought together scholars from around the world to share Arctic social science and humanities research. The Congress provides an opportunity to share research methodologies, strategies and results, and promotes international collaboration, not only among scholars, but also between scholars and practitioners. ICASS IX will address Arctic issues, and particularly issues of sustainability and sustainable development in the Arctic, from numerous multi and interdisciplinary standpoints, within the social sciences and humanities, between the social and natural sciences, and including Indigenous knowledge. All of these approaches will advance new ways of understanding the Arctic, a key region of our changing planet, both in the academic community and among the public. The requested funding will support the participation of early career researchers, Indigenous scholars, as well as northern Indigenous community members. The Congress will foster expanded collaborations between U.S. scholars and social scientists from other Arctic counties and strengthen the leading U.S. role in advancing Arctic social sciences. NSF support will also ensure that Alaska receives a prominent place at the Congress, thus benefitting Alaska scholars, residents and Alaska Native communities in particular.<br/><br/>ICASS brings together scholars and other researchers interested in issues of the North. The focus of this Congress will be on ""People and Place"" and the requested funding will be used to support the participation of early career researchers, Indigenous scholars, northern Indigenous community members, and participants from remote, underrepresented regions. Arctic researchers in the social sciences and humanities have a great responsibility to address the challenges of sustainable development in the Arctic, with a specific focus on the people that live there, including Alaska. ICASS IX will address a broad array of Arctic issues, in particular the issues of sustainability and sustainable development in the Arctic. Like previous ICASS meetings, this Congress will include a strong focus on Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. The organizers, Andrey Petrov, Diane Hirshberg (members of the organizing committee), and Peter Skold (President of the International Arctic Social Sciences Association) will help build interdisciplinary capacity and scholarship by supporting an increased participation in the Congress scholars representing a broad spectrum of disciplines.

Recent developments in neuroscience have improved detection of brain injuries and drawn public and scholarly attention to the extent of brain injury in the United States. The millions of people affected include veterans coping with the invisible disability of blast injury, women victimized by domestic violence, and athletes and children injured on playing fields. To improve care for injured people and their families, a better understanding of the experience of brain injury is needed. In its focus on the profoundly disruptive psychosocial aftermath of brain injury, the project offers a window into this experience. The project also offers a new angle on the debates over what it means to be human in a time when neurology dominates the human sciences: Have we come to see our personhood as fully dependent on our brains, and if not, on what do we found our identity and our claim to the rights of a person? Has the dominance of neuroscience limited or expanded our view of ourselves as humans, and in what ways?<br/><br/>To enter these debates, the project focuses on anger, a common and disruptive symptom of brain injury that challenges beliefs about normalcy, responsibility, and identity, and repeatedly drives injured people and their families to reassess their understanding of what it means to be a person. Through qualitative methods-including discursive analysis of the ways in which injured people and their families conceptualize these anger outbursts in published writings, in artwork, and in interviews-the project distinguishes the diverse manifestations and consequences of post-injury anger, identifies the strategies individuals and families use to manage it, and investigates how people think about the relationships between brain, mind, self, and society in the neuroscientific era. Understanding how people talk and think about post-injury anger can lead to better interventions into disrupted family systems and better ways of securing adherence to anger-management protocols, which can lead to better family relationships, a lighter burden on caregivers, and better adjustment for those who suffer from the effects of brain injury. More generally, an exposition of the ways in which we think about our brains and our personhood can inform debates about the rights of the neurologically disabled. Theoretically, the project will contribute to the sociology of culture and identity, to the sociology of health and disability, to the sociology of emotions through its focus on anger?perhaps the least studied emotion?and to the sociology of science and technology through attention to how people interpret the relevance of images of their own brains.","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1702955","Allan","Horwitz","ahorwitz@sas.rutgers.edu","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","Rutgers University New Brunswick","Piscataway","088543925","8489320150","33 Knightsbridge Road","United States","New Jersey","NJ","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jorie","Hofstra","jhofstra@sociology.rutgers.edu","04/12/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The common mathematical structures that thread the various aspects of this project together are called quantum symmetries. Quantum symmetry can be thought of as an enriched notion of symmetry, adapted to model the complex structures arising in nature. In practical contexts, mathematicians and scientists are interested in studying properties of a given system (e.g., a mechanical system, a molecule, or a population of organisms). Understanding the symmetries of such a system - transformations of the system that preserve the relevant structure - provides a wealth of insight into its properties. In many contexts, the symmetries that one encounters are described by mathematical structures called groups. However, for certain complex systems (particularly those connected to quantum mechanical phenomena, or operator algebra theory), groups are insufficient to describe the relevant symmetries that arise. This results in the need for a more general mathematical notion of symmetry, and led to the concept of a quantum group. Quantum groups were formally introduced in the 1980's as a tool to study certain types of non-classical symmetries arising in statistical physics. Since that time, quantum groups (and related notions of quantum symmetry) have proved to have remarkable applications in topology, quantum algebra, operator algebras, quantum probability, quantum information theory, and the classification of topological phases of matter. By exploiting the quantum symmetries appearing in various mathematical and physical systems, this project aims to provide new insights into challenging problems in both operator algebra theory and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project is divided into three components. The first part concerns the structural theory of von Neumman algebras associated to a class of discrete quantum groups, called orthogonal free quantum groups. The principle aim here is to use recent exciting developments in free probability theory and geometric quantum group theory to solve a conjecture which states that these von Neumann algebras can never be isomorphic to free group factors. The second part of this project concerns the structure of a class of von Neumann algebras, called the q-deformed Araki-Woods algebras. The PI will use certain asymptotic distributional symmetries for these algebras to investigate finite dimensional approximation properties and algebraic indecomposability results. The third and final part of this project proposes completely new applications of quantum symmetries in quantum information theory (QIT). The PI will investigate a new method for constructing examples of quantum channels using representation categories of quantum groups. Applications of these new quantum channels to various relevant questions in QIT will be investigated.","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1700267","Michael","Brannan","mbrannan@math.tamu.edu","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","Texas A&M University Main Campus","College Station","778454375","9798626777","400 Harvey Mitchell Pkwy South","United States","Texas","TX","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","7203","QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The three-day conference will be held annually in April at Eastern Illinois University, with the 2017 event scheduled for the weekend of April 7 through 9. This discipline-specific conference is intended to draw participants at every stage of their mathematical careers, with particular focus on both early-career graduate students and undergraduates. A meeting of this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.<br/><br/>Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will be issued annually. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life will include panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information is available at the conference website:<br/>https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1709935","Andrew","Parrish","ajnparrish@gmail.com","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","Eastern Illinois University","Charleston","619203099","2175812125","600 Lincoln Avenue","United States","Illinois","IL","1265","GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Grant","Lakeland","gslakeland@eiu.edu","04/12/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","1267",NA,NA,NA,"TOPOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many systems arising from such applications tend to exhibit chaotic behavior and can be very difficult to analyze directly. Nevertheless, it is always possible to obtain useful information about such systems by studying their long term behavior. The overarching goal of this project is to develop new methods to study the long term behavior of dynamical systems in a theoretical setting and to explore applications to the mathematical subject of combinatorics.<br/><br/>Inspired by Furstenberg's proof of Szemeredi's theorem using ergodic theory in 1977, several results in Ramsey theory and combinatorial number theory were since obtained using ideas and methods from dynamical systems. The interplay with combinatorics has likewise enriched the fields of ergodic theory and topological dynamics with a wealth of interesting new problems. The two main research directions of this project are:<br/>1. To develop new techniques within the framework of dynamical systems to solve Ramsey theoretic problems, with emphasis on those concerning partition regularity of (systems of) non-linear equations.<br/>2. To improve the understanding of the long term behaviour of measure preserving systems by exploring the phenomena of multiple recurrence and convergence of multiple ergodic averages along polynomials and other natural classes of sequences.","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1700147","Joel","Moreira","joel.moreira@northwestern.edu","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","Northwestern University","Evanston","602013149","8474913003","1801 Maple Ave.","United States","Illinois","IL","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7970",NA,NA,NA,"Combinatorics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The specific aim is to extend the planned activities by supporting and encouraging participation by a larger number of leading American researchers, including 12 junior researchers, who would otherwise not be able to participate. The planned program at the Newton Institute is to mark the centenary of D'Arcy Thompson's influential book, ""On Growth and Form"" - arguably the first treatise on the physics of living systems - by bringing various contemporary strands of inquiry in the spirit of his work into focus and to look into the future of understanding biology. The program will stimulate new interactions and collaborations between physicists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, biologists, and other researchers interested in morphology, broadly understood. It will aim to open fruitful lines of inquiry and invite new approaches to address the fundamental issues and features of form and function in living as well as inanimate systems. <br/><br/>The program will provide opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas within and across disciplines on various aspects of shape dynamics in diverse contexts and at diverse scales.

This theory also provides the natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; Groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in dynamical systems. Today, each of the theories of Operator Algebras, Groups, and Dynamical Systems are independently of each other among most important and well-established parts of modern mathematics and mathematical physics. But the framework of operator algebras still allows deep interactions between these mathematical concepts. The aim of this project is to exploit the existing, and develop new bridges between these different theories. This allows one to utilize the current advanced mathematical technology of each area to help overcome some open problems in the others.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity results for lattices in Lie groups. The former type of boundaries have since been vastly investigated and used as the main tool in some of the most substantial results in the past few decades in both ergodic theory of groups and rigidity theory of von Neumann algebras. However, topological boundaries are much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems. These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the quantum setting.","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1700259","Mehrdad","Kalantar","kalantar@math.uh.edu","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Houston","Houston","772042015","7137435773","4800 Calhoun Boulevard","United States","Texas","TX","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Systems biology seeks to understand complex biological processes by looking into the machinery of cells. Because cellular processes are often controlled by interactions which are formed and broken on a micro- or millisecond time scale, computational biophysics tools can complement systems biology experiments by tracing these transient interactions. The conference will bring together researchers from multiple disciplines by providing a platform for exchanging information on current trends in computational biophysics and systems biology, for establishing collaborations, and for obtaining a detailed understanding of cells at a molecular level. The conference will include a diverse group of invited speakers and strongly encourages participation of female and underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>CBSB2017 will include in-depth discussion of cutting-edge research results obtained by international scientists at all levels in their careers. The meeting will include 100-120 participants. Fifteen keynote and invited speakers will discuss recent algorithmic developments and present successful applications of high-performance computing in biological science. Students and postdoctoral researchers submitting the best five abstracts will be selected for young investigator awards and will be invited to give oral presentations. In addition, ten contributed talks and the poster session will provide early-career participants the opportunity to discuss their ongoing research in the context of the conference. By educating a diverse group of early-career participants, including female and underrepresented minority researchers, and by providing a forum for young scientists to present their research into the molecular workings of cells, the workshop will assist in training the next generation of computational scientists to solve fundamental problems in biophysics.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology, Molecular Biophysics and Cellular Dynamics and Function Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.","04/12/2017","04/12/2017","1740908","Ruxandra","Dima","ruxandra.dima@uc.edu","04/12/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","University of Cincinnati Main Campus","Cincinnati","452210222","5135564358","University Hall, Suite 530","United States","Ohio","OH","1114","Cellular Dynamics and Function","7465","NANOSCALE BIO CORE","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"George","Stan","george.stan@uc.edu","04/12/2017","Principal Investigator","1144","8011",NA,NA,"Molecular Biophysics","Systems and Synthetic Biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since mathematics is a fundamental part of all STEM disciplines, success of undergraduate students in mathematics is a crucial ingredient to address this challenge. Linear algebra is a vital transition course for students in the STEM disciplines because of its unifying power within mathematics and its applicability to areas outside of mathematics. Accordingly, effective instruction at this stage in students' development is paramount. The focus of this project will be to improve teaching, learning, and student success in linear algebra by incorporating a blending of technology and several learning theories and applications to lead to new research results and production of curriculum resources. This project will leverage the investigators' previous research and curriculum development in Inquiry-Oriented Linear Algebra (IOLA) and expertise in Technology Based Learning to explore the unification of curriculum design and technology design theories and practices.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: (1) create a digital platform that will equip students with a virtual experience of a version of the IOLA curriculum; (2) document the affordances and constraints for learning using a game platform (IOLA-G) in comparison to face-to-face instruction by experienced IOLA instructors; (3) compare different digital gaming formats to determine which are most conducive to inquiry-oriented learning; and (4) use the knowledge gained from (1), (2), and (3) to improve student learning through the developed technology, and, reflexively, to enhance the existing IOLA curriculum and teacher support resources. The project team will investigate students' mathematical activity and learning while the students are engaged with the digital platform and will use this insight to inform further refinement of design. Building on prior research efforts in the learning and teaching of linear algebra and expertise in Game Based Learning (GBL), the team will design IOLA-G to mimic the problem-centered approach of the existing IOLA curriculum and will iteratively refine this platform through teaching experiments with students throughout the project. The project also will explore the extent to which GBL can provide a dynamic approach to addressing the constraints that larger class sizes place on instructors' implementation of inquiry-oriented curricula. In addition to, and as part of the process of, creating the resource technology, the investigators will incorporate a mixed methods approach with a blending of game-based learning design, curriculum design theory, and research from inquiry-based learning to explore the following research questions: What are the mathematical practices that students engage in and the conceptual understandings students develop using IOLA-G compared to when using only the face-to-face IOLA curriculum? What are the affordances and constraints of different game environments in terms of enacting an inquiry-oriented curriculum?

The program increases the mathematical knowledge of preservice teachers and helps them recognize and implement equitable instruction. The preservice teachers are learning to recognize equitable practices by using the Mathematical Quality and Equity Observation Protocol (MQE) to assess teaching as viewed in video cases. The program includes mini courses of one hour that are spread throughout the program, ending just prior to student teaching.<br/><br/>Building on prior NSF-funded research, the researchers are investigating ways to help preservice teachers of mathematics at the elementary level to learn the mathematics needed for teaching and how to provide equitable instruction that encourages all students to share their mathematical thinking. Based on data collected in this exploratory study, researchers will revise the MQE and improve the validity and reliability of the instrument. They are also developing ways to use the MQE for both assessment and for instruction.<br/><br/>The materials, curriculum, and model produced by this project are helping elementary teachers learn important mathematics and learn to teach that mathematics in an equitable way. Although the model includes mini courses that are taught throughout the program, the materials can easily be adapted to a longer, traditional course for preservice teachers.

The use of complex numbers has been essential in the development of mathematics. Partial differential equations and several complex variables are employed in string theory and twistor theory, physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields. The existence and regularity of solutions to such partial differential equations are still not fully understood, and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematical analysis. The current study is not only important for the development of mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena as well, with potential applications in other sciences and technology. <br/><br/>This research focuses on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations. The topics investigated in this research project include function theory on complex manifolds, Hausdorff property of Dolbeault cohomology groups, Levi-flat hypersurfaces and complex foliation, and the Cauchy-Riemann operators on complex projective spaces and negatively curved manifolds. Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is a challenging and important problem. New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups. The study of several complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics, algebraic and complex geometry.

The method of supersymmetry is widely used in theoretical physics, especially in particle physics, but its rigorous mathematical foundation is still a challenge for mathematicians. The aim of the project is to develop a broad mathematical understanding of supersymmetry.<br/><br/>More precisely, random band matrices (RBM) represent quantum systems on a d-dimensional lattice with random quantum transition amplitudes effective up to distances of some order W, which is called a bandwidth. They are natural intermediate models in the study eigenvalue statistics and quantum propagation of disordered systems; they interpolate between Wigner random matrices and random Schrodinger operators. Wigner matrix ensembles represent models without spatial structure, where the quantum transition rates between any two sites are independent identically distributed random variables. In contrast, random Schrodinger operators have only a random diagonal potential in addition to the deterministic Laplacian on a large box in a d-dimensional lattice. The main feature of RBM is that they can be used to model the Anderson metal-insulator phase transition in three or more dimensions. It is conjectured that the crossover for RBM can be investigated even in dimension one by varying the bandwidth W; however, on a mathematical level of rigor the question is still open. The investigator is going to attack the problem using the supersymmetry approach in combination with powerful analytic and statistical mechanics techniques, including saddle point analysis, transfer operators, and multi-scale analysis.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1700009","Tetiana","Shcherbyna","tshcherbyna@princeton.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Princeton University","Princeton","085442020","6092583090","Off. of Research & Proj.

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. <br/><br/>The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1700079","Andrew","Zimmer","aazimmer@uchicago.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Chicago","Chicago","606375418","7737028669","5801 South Ellis Avenue","United States","Illinois","IL","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Palka","In this project the principal investigator will study dispersive critical and supercritical partial differential equations, further developing several recently introduced methods. Partial differential equations provide a rigorous mathematical description of many important physical, ecological, and economical theories (e.g., Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Black-Scholes model of option pricing in finance). They are studied both analytically and numerically in order to determine the long-term behavior of solutions and their dependence on initial data. In many cases, physically meaningful concepts, such as energy, mass, and momentum, play important roles, since having good control of these quantities may enable one to prove that solutions exist globally in time and to study their behavior. However, it is of great interest to study equations (called energy-supercritical) for which such quantities are insufficient to govern the solution. This class of highly nonlinear equations includes many famous and important ones that arise from modeling physical phenomena (e.g., Einstein's equations, the Navier-Stokes equation, the Yang-Mills equations, and Euler's equations).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to understand, as far as possible, the behavior of ""large"" solutions to wave equations of supercrticial type, about which little is currently known. The principal investigator's potential contribution to the subject is based on two methods: (1) splitting solutions into incoming and outgoing parts and (2) a comparison principle for the wave equation. His preliminary results apply only to some (canonical) model cases, but seem promising. It will be interesting to generalize them to the nonradial case, to all dimensions, and to other types of nonlinearities and equations. One objective of the project is to take techniques (comparison principles, sub- and supersolutions) specific to the study of elliptic and parabolic equations and apply them in a meaningful way to the supercritical wave equation. The author's approach is different from those of Kenig and Merle and of others (Tao, Krieger and Schlag, Li, Wang and Yu). It leads to unconditional results and to sharp scattering criteria in several cases. Another avenue of investigation is that of linear and nonlinear evolution equations driven by time-dependent potentials. The potential can be deterministic or random (e.g., Brownian motion). This has clear applications to the study of soliton stability and some physical problems. The methods that the principal investigator has introduced, such as a structure formula for wave operators and the use of an abstract Wiener theorem to prove dispersive estimates, provide an improved way of looking at such equations, by allowing a more general time dependence of the potential, and permit stronger conclusions to be reached.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1700293","Marius","Beceanu","mbeceanu@albany.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","SUNY at Albany","Albany","122220100","5184374550","1400 WASHINGTON AVE","United States","New York","NY","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The theory describes how a physical system, say a bunch of particles subject to certain forces, will change over time. This is important to predict the behavior of the quantum particles, such as electrons, atoms and molecules. The principal investigator will develop some fundamental methods to understand the spectra and quantum dynamical behavior of Schrodinger operators. In particular, the project focuses on the conductance properties and transport of quasi-periodic media. The results not only provide a good explanation for some phenomena in physics and chemistry, but may also have fruitful applications to modern engineering devices such as semiconductors. Undergraduate and graduate students will have opportunities to participate in some of the research.<br/><br/>This project aims at studying several aspects in mathematics by methods of functional, harmonic and geometric analysis. Quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators describe the conductivity of electrons in a two-dimensional crystal layer subject to an external magnetic field of flux acting perpendicular to the lattice plane. The principal investigator will investigate the spectral theory of quasi-periodic operators, including spectral transitions, structure of eigenfunctions in the pure point spectrum regime, and quantum dynamics of spectral measures in the singular continuous spectrum regime. The principal investigator will also study the spectral theory of Laplacians on noncompact complete Riemannian manifolds. The focus is on the existence of eigenvalues or singular continuous spectra embedded into essential spectra of Laplacians on asymptotically flat and on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as characterized by the radial curvature. The goal is to better understand relations between geometric quantities and properties of eigensolutions. Lastly the principal investigator plan to study the independence of the time-frequency translates of various classes of functions, which is stated as HRT conjecture. The priority is to prove the HRT conjecture for special configurations and HRT conjecture for exponentially decaying functions.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1700314","Wencai","Liu","wencail@uci.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Irvine","Irvine","926173213","9498247295","141 Innovation Drive, Ste 250","United States","California","CA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the trend towards urbanization, little is known about the influence of urban environments on the evolution and ecology of many animals. In Europe, a gene has been found to vary between urban and rural birds. This gene encodes a protein that transports an important hormone in and out of cells. This variation is thought to help birds cope differently with stress in urban settings by influencing mood and behavior. However, a major question remains, does this genetic variation consistently correspond to urbanization across species and around the world? This research will explore how this gene varies in different bird species inside and outside cities in the Pacific coast of the US and western Amazon of Peru. Examining the genetic differences in a diversity of birds in different locations will give us general insight into how urbanization affects bird evolution. This urban focused research will make biological science more relevant to human residents and will inform the way cities grow by recognizing that we share these landscapes with wildlife. In addition, this international research will promote scientific exchange between Peru and the US. <br/><br/>This research will focus on genetic markers associated with a serotonin transporter. To understand the background genetic diversity in these markers, the researchers will first characterize the variation at a biogeographic scale. They will do this by taking tissue samples from natural history museum collections representing the full range of six focal species and sequencing the DNA in the relevant marker regions. Then, along with local scientists in Peru, the researchers will catch birds of the same six species in two large cities, two small cities, and two rural/natural areas. The same genetic markers will be sequenced and variation between the study sites and the larger biogeographic patterns will be assessed. Because a multi-species, multi-environment, comparative approach has not been carried out before, any pattern in the results with inform our understanding of genetic diversity in the tropics and its role in resilience against urbanization. If the patterns at a fine spatial scale are consistent with those at a large spatial scale, it will show that, unlike in Europe, urbanization has not had an important effect on the distribution of alleles of this gene in these species. If the serotonin transporter genetic diversity is different at a fine spatial scale rather than a large spatial scale, while neutral genetic markers show the same patterns of diversity at fine and large spatial scales, it will indicate that this gene has perhaps been under selection associated with urbanization. If all genetic markers show differences at fine spatial scales from large spatial scales, further investigation will be needed to tease apart the roles of ecology and species selection in urban areas, making this project a valuable first foray into a case of rapid adaptive evolution in a novel environment.<br/> ","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1701727","John","Bates","jbates@fieldmuseum.org","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Chicago","Chicago","606375418","7737028669","5801 South Ellis Avenue","United States","Illinois","IL","7377","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Natalia","Piland","npiland@gmail.com","04/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because species respond to these changes in different ways, the composition of ecological communities is also changing. One important result is the movement or ""encroachment"" of woody species of shrubs and trees into grasslands around the world. Because woody plant species have very different characteristics than non-woody plants, their encroachment can have dramatic effects. For example, encroaching plants may affect microbial organisms living in the soil, such as bacteria and fungi. These soil organisms are very important for nutrient cycling and soil health because they break down decaying plant and animal material and fertilize the soil in ways that affect plant growth. Therefore, changes in the species of microbial organisms, or how they function, could in turn affect other plants in the area. This research studies how a woody species, a sagebrush shrub, that is moving uphill in the White Mountains of California, affects composition and function of soil microbial communities and the plant species they associate with. This work will be helpful in improving land management strategies in areas experiencing woody plant encroachment. It will enable training of graduate and undergraduate students and outreach to a museum and local conservation groups.<br/><br/><br/>This project will build upon previous work demonstrating that in the White Mountains, sagebrush has been expanding its range into alpine grasslands over the last 50 years. The project will integrate field and greenhouse experiments, modern molecular and enzymatic tools for characterizing soil communities, and plant demographic modeling to: 1) assess effects of sagebrush on soil fungal community structure and extracellular enzyme production, and 2) determine how these belowground changes feed back to affect the performance of other native alpine plants. The primary hypothesis is that native range-expanding species may affect soil microbial communities in ways that have critical feedbacks on the fitness of the existing plant community, including altering nutrient cycling and the relative frequency of pathogens vs. mutualists. This research will result in a more complete understanding of the above- and belowground impacts of alpine shrub expansion. Results will provide valuable information on the long-term status of alpine plant species under future environmental and landscape change, and the underlying mechanisms that link soil microbial communities and plant performance.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1701979","Jeffrey","Diez","jeffrey.diez@ucr.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Riverside","RIVERSIDE","925211000","9518275535","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Courtney","Collins","courtney.collins@email.ucr.edu","04/13/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Every year, ISWC brings together researchers, product vendors, fashion designers, textile manufacturers, users, and related professionals to share information and advances in wearable computing. The conference typically includes dedicated workshops, a juried design competition, a lively gadget show, and high-quality paper presentation sessions revealing the latest in wearable computing progress. More information about this conference may be found at http://www.iswc.net/iswc17/. The joint ISWC/UbiComp Doctoral Colloquium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in the various fields associated with ubiquitous computing, by affording them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Many participants in past UbiComp doctoral consortia have since gone on to high profile research careers. The event organizers are committed to achieving diversity among the student participants, including in terms of gender and ethnicity. To further support diversity, no more than 2 students will be accepted from any one institution.<br/><br/>The goals of the joint ISWC/UbiComp Doctoral Colloquium are: to provide a forum that will allow senior-level doctoral students to attend the ISWC/UbiComp conferences and take part as contributors to the program, as well as encourage further participation in the future; to give emerging ISWC and UbiComp researchers the opportunity to present their work and receive feedback, guidance, and encouragement from respected researchers to whom they may not have ready access at their home institutions; to provide opportunities for discussion among senior-level doctoral students to expose them to new perspectives on their field and in closely related fields; to foster the building of research relationships that will continue to benefit the students as they progress in their careers; and to expose the diversity and depth of research in the field as being undertaken by junior researchers to the greater UbiComp/ISWC community. To these ends, the format of the doctoral colloquium will facilitate the open exchange of ideas and in-depth discussion among members of the next generation of wearable and ubiquitous computing researchers and established top researchers in the area. The colloquium will begin with a joint session in which all participants will present a 1-minute version of their research. Subsequently, participants will present in-depth in two parallel tracks, attended by the respective conference panels. Students will be encouraged to move freely between the sessions, attending presentations according to their interests. The colloquium will close with a joint career development panel. Meals and breaks will be shared. Presentations will be scheduled with ample time allotted for questions and constructive feedback from the panel and from the other student participants. Particular emphasis will be given to such topics as focusing research questions and ensuring that research activities appropriately address the research questions, the selection and application of fitting and correct methods given the intended contributions of the work, and the appropriate analysis, framing, and communication of findings, results, and contributions. Additional opportunities for more informal discussion and networking will be during the DC lunch and dinner events. Extended abstracts from the DC will be distributed in the conference's supplemental proceedings to all conference attendees, and indexed in the ACM and IEEE digital libraries, offering further exposure. Finally, colloquium participants will also be asked to prepare a poster for a joint ISWC/UbiComp DC poster session as part of the main conference.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1738242","Anind","Dey","anind@cs.cmu.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Carnegie-Mellon University","PITTSBURGH","152133815","4122689527","5000 Forbes Avenue","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","7367","Cyber-Human Systems (CHS)","7367","Cyber-Human Systems","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"1099","The Role of Distributed Foci of Tissue Stiffness in Cell-Cell Adhesion","01/01/2017","08/31/2017","243192","Standard Grant","07030000","Directorate For Engineering","Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn","David Fyhrie","The tissues of the body stiffen with age and also with the progression of numerous diseases. It is now known that this change in stiffness can drive disease by causing cells within the tissue to adopt unhealthy behaviors. However, tissues do not stiffen uniformly. The tissues can develop numerous small foci of stiffness so that the stiffness varies markedly throughout. It is not yet known how cells respond to these distributed foci of stiffness that develop with age and disease. This award supports the research necessary to understand how the process of aging contributes to the development of stiffness foci and how these stiff foci alter cell function. The primary activity in this work will be on the development of mechanical stiffness foci within blood vessels and the evaluation of their effects on the cells within the blood vessel wall. However, this basic research will have a broad impact on current understanding of physiology and pathology throughout the body, as changes in tissue stiffness with age can occur in multiple different organ systems. As such, this work will have broad impact to society. The project involves techniques from cell biology, materials science, optics, and microfabrication. This multi-disciplinary approach coupled with research activities designed to involve diverse sets of researchers and students will help train engineers to think and work across disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>While ""heterogeneity"" is now appreciated as an important component of biology, the primary focus to-date has been on cell-to-cell molecular-level heterogeneities. However, heterogeneities also exist in the extracellular environment and have been largely overlooked. Many tissues display foci of mechanical stiffness - heterogeneities in stiffness that exist over just a few microns. This project will address the stiffness foci that develop in tissue and their effects on cell-cell adhesion and force generation. In this project, the major research goal is to characterize these foci and their biophysical effects on endothelial cell-cell adhesion using state-of-the-art tools including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), microfabrication, and ex vivo models. These studies have the potential to identify a novel mechanism by which age contributes to endothelial dysfunction. More importantly, this work will bring to light the role of mechanical heterogeneities within the matrix on cell biophysics. While the research here will be on the endothelium, it is expected that the results will be relevant to many tissues and pathologies including cancer and embryonic development where heterogeneities in mechanical properties also exist.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1738345","Cynthia","Reinhart-King","cynthia.reinhart-king@vanderbilt.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Vanderbilt University","Nashville","372350002","6153222631","Sponsored Programs Administratio","United States","Tennessee","TN","7479","Biomechanics & Mechanobiology","024E","MATERIALS DESIGN","027E","NANOMECHANICS","028E","BIOMECHANICS","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","9102","WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

From an elementary perspective, translation surfaces can be viewed as a polygon with a recipe for gluing its edges. For example, gluing opposite sides of a square produces a torus, which is the mathematical name for the shape of a doughnut. Most spectacularly, these polygons quickly lead to deep mathematics at the frontiers of research and they intersect a wide range of fields including algebra, geometry, and dynamical systems. Furthermore, translation surfaces have started to appear in mathematical physics with connections to quantum mechanics. From an educational standpoint, polygons arise in high school geometry and the PI has successfully explained to high school students how to find periodic trajectories of a ball on a rectangular table, using standard reflecting rules, using translation surfaces. The elementary nature of polygons allows undergraduates to meaningfully experiment with them using software, such as Sage, which is open source software that is freely available on the internet. The PI has already developed projects for undergraduates concerning translation surfaces.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are threefold. First, the PI will study the geometry of orbit closures of translation surfaces through classification problems. Secondly, the PI will apply his knowledge of the geometry of orbit closures to resolve questions concerning dynamics in moduli space and on translation surfaces. He will approach problems concerning the anomalous behavior of Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle through a conjecture he proposes. Finally, he will study the structure of quadratic differentials with higher order poles on finite genus Riemann surfaces, which has applications to mathematical physics.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1738381","David","Aulicino","aulicino@math.uchicago.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","CUNY Brooklyn College","Brooklyn","112102889","7189515622","Office of Research & Sponsored P","United States","New York","NY","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Manipulating plant hormones with chemical and genetic tools has been instrumental in the green revolution; a deeper understanding of how hormones control plant growth will likely fuel future advances in agriculture. In this project, biological sensors will be developed to detect a recently recognized plant hormone called strigolactone, and an unknown molecule in plants (KL) that controls seed germination, seedling growth, and leaf shape. The biological sensors will be used in this project to purify KL, which may be a novel hormone, and to identify genes that produce it. Discovery of KL may lead to the development of new agrichemicals or genetic modifications that promote uniform seed germination and seedling vigor, thus increasing crop yields. Strigolactone sensors will be useful tools for plant breeders to more easily develop crops with altered strigolactone levels, which can in turn influence the fertilizer requirements of crops and their susceptibility to weeds. Undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained in research skills and scientific communication, leading to enhancement of the scientific workforce. Research discoveries will be communicated to the public through journal publications, press releases, news articles, and local speaking opportunities.<br/><br/>Karrikins are compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination after fire and enhance seedling vigor. The karrikin signaling pathway is highly similar to the strigolactone signaling pathway, suggesting common ancestry. A receptor that is necessary for karrikin responses, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2), has been identified, but karrikins are unlikely to be its native ligand. The aims of this project are to (1) develop sensitive and specific biological assays to detect the unknown KAI2 ligand (KL) and strigolactones, (2) identify genes involved in KL biosynthesis, and (3) highly purify KL from plant extracts as a stepping stone toward its identification. Biological sensors for karrikins/KL and strigolactones based on transcriptional or proteolytic responses will be engineered. These bioassays will be used in genetic screens to identify KL-deficient mutants. Finally, bioassay-guided fractionation will be used to isolate KL in small molecule extracts from plants. The discovery of KL and KL biosynthesis genes will catalyze a new field of research in plant biology that impacts the understanding of seed dormancy, seedling photomorphogenesis, and leaf development. It will also provide insights into the ancestral function of the KAI2 signaling mechanism in basal land plants, which later duplicated and evolved to mediate growth control by strigolactones.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1740560","David","Nelson","dcnelson@uga.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Riverside","RIVERSIDE","925211000","9518275535","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","1118","PLANT FUNGAL & MICROB DEV MECH","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","9251","RES EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD-SUPPLT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Skin issues are the most frequently addressed issues presented in primary care: over one-third of primary care visits include at least one skin problem. Skin issues are visual manifestations of many different types of diseases, including allergies, injuries, bacterial infections, viral infections, and hormonal fluctuations. A physician's ability to address skin issues is highly dependent on a physician's prior visual training experiences. However, many physicians are not regularly familiar with the over 2,000 dermatology issues that can arise in a patient. The algorithms developed here allow for objective and much more accurate screening of exposed skin to improve evaluation of patient issues in many different care settings. This could be implemented for many different types of skin diseases and other visual constructions of images to assist physicians visually and vastly augment their sensitivity and specificity at identifying dermatology issues and their underlying causes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on using image processing and machine learning to distinguish dermatological diseases. Image-capturing electronics such as consumer-grade cameras and smartphones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, capable, and affordable. Image processing and machine learning based on annotated images has shown great potential for algorithms to differentiate between images capturing different objects and patterns. The developments here have created a classification system that differentiates suspicious from non-suspicious lesions that is easy for a physician to use in a clinical setting to help with clinical decision-making. The proof of concept is based on a large dataset of prospective clinical images where the algorithms classified malignant cases and the methods resulted in a statistically significant discrimination between suspicious and non-suspicious lesions.","04/13/2017","04/13/2017","1741564","Roman","Lubynsky","rml@mit.edu","04/13/2017","Principal Investigator","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Cambridge","021394301","6172531000","77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE","United States","Massachusetts","MA","8023","I-Corps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The calcar is a 'neomorphism,'it suddenly appears in the earliest bats but is not found in their ancestors: its appearance in the fossil record is difficult to explain. The bat calcar is particularly exceptional because it varies extensively across bat species, suggesting that anatomical variation may have functional and ecological implications. Therefore, the calcar offers a unique model system for studying the processes that generate anatomical novelty and diversity in vertebrates. In this project, the researchers will link approaches from developmental biology and biomechanics in order to explain the evolution of the calcar and to explore its functional relevance across the global radiation of bats. The researchers will also create education and outreach activities that will promote the utility of interdisciplinary research for solving enduring questions in biology.<br/><br/>The researchers' primary goal is to use the calcar of bats (Chiroptera) to understand how developmental modifications can lead to the formation of novel skeletal structures and to functionally-relevant variability in those structures. The specific objectives of this project are to 1) reveal the developmental origin of the calcar and discern its homology among bats, and 2) identify developmental processes that lead to differences in connective tissue composition among calcars (i.e., why some calcars calcify or ossify while others do not). These objectives will be addressed using histochemical and immunofluorescent assays of bat embryos representing phylogenetically, morphologically, and ecologically diverse species. These experiments will expand on the researchers' recent work on calcar functional anatomy and biomechanics. This project will strengthen the ability of the researchers to test their overarching hypothesis: the evolution of the calcar resulted from modifications in developmental regulation of chondrogenesis and ossification leading to adaptive evolution.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1700845","Sharlene","Santana","ssantana@uw.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Washington","Seattle","981950001","2065434043","4333 Brooklyn Ave NE","United States","Washington","WA","1171","PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kathryn","Stanchak","stanchak@uw.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this project, researchers will focus on bacteria in honey bee guts, because gut bacteria affect animals' health. They will study how these bacteria interact with one another, because this is important for how stable helpful gut bacterial communities are, and how they interact with the host animal. The researchers will continue working with two critical bacteria in the bee gut. They have already shown how these bacteria have toxins with which they can attack one another. However, it is likely that these bacteria also help one another in some situations. The researchers will use recently developed methods to look at whether and how these bacteria pass nutrients to one another and to the host bee. This will contribute to understanding how bee-gut bacterial communities stay stable through time. It will help to develop new routes to improving bee health. In addition, during the project graduate and undergraduate researchers will be trained in state-of-the-art methods in microbiology.<br/><br/>As insects can take up and utilize byproducts of carbohydrate fermentation, honeybees may benefit from the metabolic activities of members of their gut microbial communities through both the degradation of toxic sugars and the production of useful byproducts. To better understand the role of cooperative metabolic interactions in gut communities, this project will trace nutrient exchange in the honeybee gut. Genomic evidence suggests that the bee gut microbes Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola depend upon one another for production of nutrients. G. apicola metabolizes carbohydrates that S. alvi cannot, and metabolizes sugars found in nectar that are toxic to honey bees. This project will use isotopically-labeled monosaccharides that can be utilized by G. apicola, but not by S. alvi or the host, to trace metabolic interactions in the bee gut. DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) will be used to track incorporation of labeled carbon atoms into bacterial DNA, while incorporation of these atoms into host tissues will be measured through elemental analysis and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This research will contribute to a greater fundamental understanding of the processes that govern cooperative metabolic interactions among members of the gut microbiota and between the microbiota and the host, and will demonstrate the important potential role of SIP methods in hypothesis testing in microbial community ecology, a framework in which it is uncommonly used.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1701430","Nancy","Moran","nancy.moran@austin.utexas.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Texas at Austin","Austin","787121532","5124716424","101 E. 27th Street, Suite 5.300","United States","Texas","TX","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marvin","Whiteley","mwhiteley@mail.utexas.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Margaret","Steele","margaret_steele@utexas.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Like us, many animals have immune systems that help them to fight diseases. However, many animals also use medicines. Animals often use plants as sources of medicine and must search their local ?green pharmacy? for the appropriate drugs. These natural medicines are used together with the immune system to help the animal fight infection. But what happens when the quality of plant-based medicines changes because the environment changes? Scientists do not fully understand how our rapidly changing world will affect animal immunity and, through it, disease in natural populations. Monarch butterflies are attacked by a parasite that is related to those that cause malaria and toxoplasmosis in humans. When monarchs get infected with their parasite, they find it difficult to fly and to reproduce. However, monarchs can use natural medicines in milkweed plants in combination with their own immune systems to help combat their parasites. This research will help scientists understand how the medicinal compounds that are available in milkweed change with the environment, and how changes in medicines available to the butterflies affect their ability to use them to fight the parasite. New diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate and the impacts of environmental change on animal immune function may make this trend worse. Understanding the influence of environmental change on animal immunity will help scientists and managers to predict which animals are most at risk and where, as well as facilitate improved management decisions.<br/><br/><br/>This project will address how changing medicinal and nutritional quality affects parasites' ability to harm their hosts. It will do so by exploring the effects of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on the medicinal (secondary chemistry) and nutritional (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) quality of host diet. The researchers will examine how dietary effects on immunity underlie corresponding shifts in a host?s ability to limit parasite infection success, and mitigate the fitness costs of infection at a given pathogen load. This work will be conducted using a system with a high degree of diet dependency: the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, and its protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). Secondary and primary metabolites of the milkweed (Asclepias) plants that monarchs consume convey increased performance against OE.

One of the reasons invasive shrubs may impact native ecosystems so greatly is that they have an extended period with leaves, as compared to native woody species, also called extended leaf phenology (ELP). Phenology is the timing of biological phenomena that correspond to climatic conditions. This earlier leaf emergence in the spring and/or later leaf fall in the autumn creates shade at unique times of the year. So far, studies comparing ELP of invasive compared to native shrubs have been done at single locations. However, we know that cues that drive leaf phenology, for example temperature, vary greatly from region to region and from year to year. So, when we compare regions across the eastern U.S., will we find differences in leaf phenology between native and invasive shrubs? Are there regions where it is important to focus management efforts because ELP of invading shrubs is greater? How will leaf phenology change with temperature changes? To address these questions, researchers have developed a citizen science campaign called ""Shady Invaders"" to collect leaf phenology observations across the eastern U.S. Through participant training and eNewsletter and webinar updates, both the public and scientific research are enriched from this collaboration. <br/><br/><br/>Species-specific leaf phenology data are impossible to collect simultaneously across a regional scale without numerous observers. Fortunately, data collection is straightforward, allowing the growing efforts of citizen scientists to be applied to this problem. Regional citizen science phenology observations for native and invasive shrubs will provide insight into the spatial extent and consistency of the novel leaf phenology of invasive shrubs across eastern U.S. and will contribute to our understanding of the broader applicability of local-scale research on this topic. The landscape-scale, multi-year approach can be used to predict the potential implications of climate change for leaf phenology by developing a predictive model for phenology. Through collaboration with researchers from China, phenology data are being incorporated from the native range of the shrub species invading forests of eastern U.S. to understand whether novel phenology arose as a product of evolutionary pressures in the native range (pre-adaptation), or more recently in the introduced range (rapid adaptation with range expansion). This will contribute to pressing research questions as well as informing whether leaf phenology is a useful tool for predicting and preventing future invasions.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1701470","Margot","Kaye","mwk12@psu.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Pennsylvania State Univ University Park","UNIVERSITY PARK","168027000","8148651372","110 Technology Center Building","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT","SMET","SCIENCE, MATH, ENG & TECH EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Erynn","Maynard","eem212@psu.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In making predictions about epidemics, people consider how and when susceptible and infected hosts come into contact with one another, but they generally do not consider what happens after the parasite gets inside its host. However, the within-host battles between host and parasite could also be important for disease spread. These within-host battles happen because a host's body is constantly resisting and defending against parasites. It is important to consider these dynamics in predicting disease dynamics because not all hosts are equally equipped to fend off parasites and diseases. Ultimately, hosts that have lower immunity are more likely to allow parasites to spread. In this project, the researcher will focus on populations of an invertebrate that lives in lakes in which they experience large parasite epidemics every year. The researcher will improve our understanding of disease spread by incorporating information about how variability in immunity affects it with host-to-host contact information. The results of this project will help scientists better understand the importance of immune defenses when parasites infect humans, farm animals, and wildlife populations. It will also enable the training of a graduate student, and support projects aimed at encouraging underrepresented minority, female and low-income undergraduate and grade school students to be involved in science.<br/><br/>Our understanding of how ecological and immunological factors interact in natural populations to determine both an individual's probability of infection and the subsequent overall disease prevalence remains limited. Working with a model host-parasite system (Daphnia host and fungal parasite), this research examines the mechanisms underlying immune function, as well as the consequences of variable immunity for parasite transmission. Specifically, the researcher will examine how environmental stressors (e.g. resource quality and availability) shape natural Daphnia populations' mean levels of and variation in immune function. The establishment and spread of the highly virulent parasite within these populations will then be quantified, while tracking each population's levels of exposure and infection success through time. The research relies on tools from multiple disciplines, including ecology, quantitative biology, transcriptomics, and immunology. Moreover, the project integrates theories from disease ecology and ecological immunology to examine disease processes across scales: from the genome, to the individual, to the population and community.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1701515","Carla","Caceres","caceres@life.illinois.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","CHAMPAIGN","618207473","2173332187","SUITE A","United States","Illinois","IL","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tara","Stewart","tarastew@illinois.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Microorganisms live all over the surfaces and inside of every type of larger organism on the planet, forming what is known as the ""microbiome"" of the larger hosts. This research will focus on the microbiomes of plants, which have profound impacts on plant health and performance. This research will focus on how microbiomes affect resistance of a host to another microorganism: a disease-causing fungus. By experimentally manipulating combinations of microbiomes, host species, and whether or not the disease-causing fungus is present, the researchers will be able to find out how microbiomes affect the ability of different plant species to compete with one another and to resist disease. By growing microbes found in natural microbiomes and by using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing approaches, they will begin to identify how important microbial players affect plant health. This project will involve the training of a graduate student in cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques. Because one outcome of this work will be to identify how and whether inoculating plants with the right microbiome protects against disease, the results from this work will also contribute to the development of new approaches to fighting costly pathogens in crops, and to helping land managers promote biodiversity in natural systems. <br/><br/><br/>In the past three decades, the plant-soil feedback framework has been used to achieve theoretical and empirical breakthroughs. Phyllosphere microbial communities, which reside in or on aboveground plant tissues, are similarly diverse, but current research suffers from an inability to connect presence and identity of phyllosphere microbes to larger ecological questions. In this project, researchers will test how pathogen infection alters the fitness and growth outcomes of con- vs. heterospecific phyllosphere microbial communities, with a focus on the fungal constituents of these microbiomes. Next-generation sequencing technologies will be combined with culture-dependent approaches to study the mechanisms of fungal community assembly in the phyllosphere. Functional trait data will be collected on select fungal cultures as metrics of plant-fungal and pathogen-fungal interactions. This trait-based approach will then be used to determine whether specific traits of the fungi measured in the lab can be used to understand their abundance and role on plants. This body of work has the potential to expand the scientific community's understanding of phyllosphere community assembly, and the mechanisms by which different phyllosphere communities inhibit or facilitate plant-species coexistence on their own or in conjunction with pathogens.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1701816","Keith","Clay","CLAY@Indiana.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","Indiana University","Bloomington","474013654","8128550516","509 E 3RD ST","United States","Indiana","IN","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Briana","Whitaker","brkawhit@indiana.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While many people are familiar with how antibiotics are used for human health, the vast majority of antibiotics produced today are used to promote the health and growth of livestock. As with many medicines, up to 80% of the total dosage of active antibiotics are eliminated through animal waste, like feces and urine, and introduced to the surrounding environment. Although previous research has found more antibiotic-resistant organisms near livestock farms than generally, scientists do not fully understand how antibiotics coming from livestock waste impact important organisms in soils that are exposed to them: soil microbes, like bacteria and fungi, and invertebrates, like millipedes, pillbugs, spiders and insects. Healthy communities of microbes and invertebrates are responsible for recycling nutrients in soils and making them available to plants and the animals that eat them. This research will help scientists understand how the common practice of adding antibiotics to soils, by applying contaminated livestock manure to crop soils, may be disrupting the nutrient-cycling soil organisms, and how well these organisms can make nutrients available. Through this research, scientists, farmers and the public can promote responsible waste management practices that will help protect our ecosystems and benefit human health. The project will also train a graduate student, and American Indian volunteer researchers.<br/><br/>Using antibiotic (tetracycline)-laden manure from cattle, this research will consist of a series of field experiments that assess how antibiotic compounds change decomposition rates in the soil, microbial respiration (an important factor in carbon and nutrient cycling), and microbial and invertebrate community composition. The researcher will also test how the microbiome of invertebrate communities raised on antibiotic-laden manure compares to those raised on untreated manure. This research fills a critical gap in our understanding of three important ecological phenomena: (1) how antibiotics affect community structure of soil microbes and invertebrates, (2) which invertebrate and microbial taxa are most important to decomposition and greenhouse gas emission, and (3) how disrupting invertebrate microbiomes drives mortality in invertebrate communities. Furthermore, by conducting our proposed study at an agricultural field site, we provide insight into what governs the health and function of a globally prominent and economically important ecosystem.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1701831","Michael","Kaspari","MKASPARI@OU.EDU","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Oklahoma Norman Campus","NORMAN","730199705","4053254757","201 Stephenson Parkway","United States","Oklahoma","OK","1182","POP & COMMUNITY ECOL PROG","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jane","Lucas","jane.m.lucas-1@ou.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These devices are constructed using compounds that exhibit a liquid crystal phase. Molecules in this phase can be reoriented in the presence of an electric field, which changes their optical properties. With support from this grant by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program compounds are prepared and studied that exhibit a unique type of liquid crystal phase in which the molecules can potentially undergo faster reorientation. This could lead to faster liquid crystal displays, which would improve the optical quality of the devices, and lower the amount of energy consumed by the devices. Undergraduate students at the University of Puget Sound are directly involved in all aspects of the NSF-funded research. Participation in research offers an excellent opportunity for students to enhance their critical thinking skills. These experiences provide students with strong technical training that will serve them well as they enter the workforce in a scientific field or pursue graduate studies in Chemistry or a related area. At the University of Puget Sound, 57% of the students are women, and 25% of the students identify as students of color. This support from NSF helps the PI to provide research opportunities to students from groups who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>There has been intense interest in the biaxial nematic phase (Nb) since it was reported in high melting bent-core compounds; liquid crystal displays fabricated using this phase have the potential to undergo faster electro-optic switching. However, there is controversy as to whether this phase is truly a biaxial nematic phase; recent evidence suggests the phase consists of layered (smectic) domains (cybotactic clusters) that show nematic order only across larger length scales. This grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program supports the synthesis of a variety of oxadiazole-based compounds, and analysis of their liquid crystalline behavior. These studies provide critical insight into how various structural factors affect the stability and nature of the nematic phase in bent-core compounds. The preparation of series of compounds with 1) various lateral groups, 2) highly polar substituents, and 3) amide linkages allow the PI and his students to generate structure-property relationships, with the intention to learn what structural features yield a nematic phase with a low onset temperature. Synthesis of the target compounds and initial analysis of phase behavior (using polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry) are carried out at the University of Puget Sound. Collaborators of the PI study the compounds by X-ray diffraction, which provides detailed information about the molecular organization within the nematic phase. They also carry out electro-optic experiments on the derivatives with highly polar groups as these are candidates for ferroelectric switching. Having derivatives with low temperature nematic phases would facilitate both fundamental study by physicists and investigation of possible applications.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. Contemporary science education reforms consider modeling as a means to understanding science ideas and as an essential scientific practice to be learned. Modeling is the practice of developing and refining representations (or ""models"") as analogs of scientific phenomena. Important to the practice of modeling is the idea that, as an analog, a model draws out (or ""abstracts"") some as opposed to all aspects of a phenomenon. However, a well-known problem in modeling instruction is that leaners have difficulty understanding this essential point. Learners often think of models as literal interpretations, or replicas, of what they represent. The investigators hypothesize that engaging students in a process of abstraction -- that is, drawing out common structures from multiple scientific phenomena -- during the creation (or ""synthesis"") of their own model will help students better understand the nature of scientific models. Importantly, this approach will help students discover that a scientific model is not simply a literal interpretation, or replica, of any single phenomenon. Sixteen teachers and their estimated 960 students from economically challenged communities in Georgia and Maine will participate in and benefit from the research study in the context of high school earth and environmental science classes. The project will develop a short instructional sequence and new student learning assessments that are implemented in earth science classes. The findings will help the field to understand whether the process of abstracting from multiple phenomena during model construction supports students' understanding of scientific models in relation to earth science ideas and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The project will provide professional development workshops to up to forty-six teachers over three years as means of recruiting research participants and to cultivate teacher leadership around the new approach to modeling. The developed products and the research findings will be shared with researchers, teacher educators, and teachers through science education journals and conferences. <br/><br/>This Exploratory Learning Strand research study builds upon prior work of investigators at University of Georgia and University of Maine by rigorously testing their hypothesis that that engaging students in the process of abstracting from multiple source phenomena during model synthesis supports more scientifically accurate understandings of the nature of models. The research has the potential to (1) generate new knowledge about the potential value of abstraction as a guiding principle of learning about models and modeling practice; (2) identify ways in which specific classroom conditions, including teacher talk and actions, enable or hinder student learning about abstraction in models and modeling practice; and (3) demonstrate how teachers translate the modeling approach to other science disciplines they teach. Teachers will be recruited through existing partnerships with schools and through professional development workshops offered to teachers nearby the two universities. To address the first two goals, the investigators will develop and test a two-part instructional sequence that addresses core ideas in earth science and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The first component of the instructional sequence is a typical model-based inquiry, and the second component requires that students abstract structures from multiple phenomena during the synthesis of their own models. Twelve teachers and their students will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The treatment group will experience the two-part instructional sequence. The control group will initially not experience the second component, but will have an opportunity to do so at the conclusion of the study. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of classroom observations, interviews with teachers, student knowledge tests, student work, and teacher logs will be used to determine the effectiveness of abstracting during model synthesis and classroom conditions that enable or hinder students' learning when the approach is used. To address the third goal, investigators will document the experience of four teachers as they develop and implement a similar instructional sequence in other science disciplines, providing preliminary evidence on the broader utility of the synthesis-through-abstraction approach to modeling. A new research assessment for measuring students' understanding of the nature of models, core ideas of earth science, and the cross-cutting concept of scale may be broadly useful for future research on learning at the intersection of the three knowledge dimensions. Findings will be shared by traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed research and practitioner journals and conference presentations. Investigators will conduct professional development workshops for teachers in the third year to disseminate the products and findings of the research to practitioner audiences and to further cultivate participating teachers' leadership around this novel approach to modeling practice in science education.","04/14/2017","04/14/2017","1720996","Daniel","Capps","dacapps@uga.edu","04/14/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","ATHENS","306021589","7065425939","310 East Campus Rd","United States","Georgia","GA","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jonathan","Shemwell","jonathan.shemwell@maine.edu","04/14/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, the three dimensional nature of physical systems makes it provably impossible to express closed-form analytical solutions for even the simplest systems. This has made experimentation the primary modality for designing new cyber-physical systems (CPS). Since physical prototyping and experiments are typically costly and hard to conduct, ""virtual experiments"" in the form of modeling and simulation can dramatically accelerate innovation in CPS. Unfortunately, major technical challenges often impede the effectiveness of modeling and simulation. This project develops foundations and tools for overcoming these challenges. The project focuses on robotics as an important, archetypical class of CPS, and consists of four key tasks: 1) Compiling and analyzing a benchmark suite for modeling and simulating robots, 2) Developing a meta-theory for relating cyber-physical models, as well as tools and a test bed for robot modeling and simulation, 3) Validating the research results of the project using two state-of-the-art robot platforms that incorporate novel control technologies and will require novel programming techniques to fully realize their potential 4) Developing course materials incorporating the project's research results and test bed.<br/><br/>With the aim of accelerating innovation in a wide range of domains including stroke rehabilitation and prosthetic limbs, the project is developing new control concepts and modeling and simulation technologies for robotics.

Lukin","This project will utilize a facility called Plasma Krystal-4 (PK-4) on the International Space Station to conduct experiments in microgravity investigating the underlying physics behind self-ordering of interacting complex plasma dust particles. Complex plasma, also known as dusty plasma, consist of ions, electrons and charged nanometer to micron sized solid particles known as dust. Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community. For example, the material from which stars and planets form, interstellar clouds, and even planetary rings all consist of dusty plasma. Dusty plasmas are also present on the Earth, particularly in industrial plasma applications, while the controlled formation of dust crystals in a laboratory setting provides a useful analog for both atomic and molecular systems, allowing fundamental progress in our understanding of the physics involved. As such, dusty plasma research enables the progress of science while allowing insight into practical issues of yield efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing. This award will also impact the STEM workforce through engagement of students who will develop computation and modeling skills, obtain practical experience with instrumentation, and improve their technical writing and presentation skills. <br/><br/>A proper understanding of the physics underlying the field of dusty plasma research is complicated by the fact that the majority of research conducted occurs in a gravitational environment (i.e., on the Earth). This project directly addresses this issue, utilizing a multinational collaboration to compare studies on self-ordering of interacting complex plasma dust particles collected on the Earth to experimental results employing the PK-4 facility under microgravity. Data obtained will be compared with data from two different ground-based experiments as well as to results provided by numerical modeling of the plasma / dust environment using a comprehensive set of analysis techniques. This combination will be used to define the parameter space where particular wave modes can exist, and to develop comprehensive theories on interparticle potential and grain-plasma interactions, determining the microscopic and macroscopic properties of the complex plasma. The results obtained will directly impact research in astrophysics and planetary science (e.g., dust in protoplanetary disks, charged dust on the surface of airless bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, planetary ring systems), atmospheric physics (e.g., noctilucent clouds), fusion research (e.g., dust contamination), materials physics (e.g., soft matter, metastable states, complex fluids, granular matter), and advanced manufacturing (e.g., semiconductor, etching, and deposition systems).

This export is especially pronounced in the Midwestern U.S., where large areas of agriculture have left exposed soils that easily wash away during storms. These large pulses of sediments and nutrients to lakes during storms can affect drinking water quality, recreational opportunities, and commercial and sport fishing. It is expected that storms in the Midwestern U.S. will increase in severity and frequency over the next 100 years. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to understand how lakes will respond to storms under these changing conditions. In addition, this project will directly support the research of one doctoral student, and will provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will experimentally examine what factors contribute to lake ecosystem resilience following storm events, using replicated aquatic mesocosms (5000 liter tanks) that simulate conditions during large storm events in a lake. This research will answer three general questions: (1) Do larger detritus pools speed lake resilience (the time necessary for ecosystems to recover) following large storm events? (2) How do additions of sediment and nutrients that occur during large storm events affect lake recovery time? and (3) How do additions of sediment and nutrients and detritus pool size interactively affect lake resilience? The experiment will include manipulations of detritus pool size, hydraulic flushing (a physical disturbance that reduces the amount of algae), and addition of sediment and nutrients. A factorial design will be used to isolate the mechanisms that influence lake recovery following large storm events. Understanding how these factors interact is essential to understanding ecosystem resilience and for effective management of water quality in lakes and reservoirs.","04/16/2017","04/16/2017","1701825","Tanner","Williamson","willi571@miamioh.edu","04/16/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","Miami University","Oxford","450563653","5135293600","500 E High Street","United States","Ohio","OH","1181","ECOSYSTEM STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"William","Renwick","renwicwh@muohio.edu","04/16/2017","Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Palka","This project seeks to answer questions about, to develop an improved mathematical understanding of, and to build more sophisticated tools involved in the modeling of phenomena driven by nonlocal interactions. A nonlocal interaction can be illustrated by its contrast to a local interaction in a simplified picture of a population of agents (say, people) interacting across a shared network. A local model is one in which people can share information only with their immediate neighbors, whereas a nonlocal model is one in which they can share information more broadly, possibly across an entire network, and do so instantly. This simplified picture actually manifests itself in many situations in which a nonlocal paradigm is more fruitful than a local one, and the inclusion of nonlocal interactions often fundamentally changes the underlying mathematics that describe aspects such as the propagation of information. This project aims to improve the study of such phenomena through the introduction of new mathematical tools. Along the way, this project will support the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduates through involvement in research on these topics. It will also create new graduate course material that provides a more unified approach to nonlocal tools of use in treating certain current topics in data science. <br/><br/>In the realm of mathematics surrounding nonlocal problems, there has been a surge of activity during the past twenty years. Experts have found themselves addressing questions in roughly two categories: (1) What properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of nonlocality itself; and (2) what properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of integrating them with other fields? In this project the principal investigators focus on the second type of question. They aim to develop nonlocal tools that can be applied to some classical problems that are not, at first glance, necessarily nonlocal, including questions about oscillatory boundary-layer phenomena for elliptic equations and free-boundary problems of one or two phases. The key point is that there are powerful tools in the nonlocal world that could shed new light upon or produce new results for some of these equations that were not approached from this perspective earlier. Such tools include, but are not limited to, the fast growing regularity theory for nonlocal equations and theory of weak solutions for nonlocal equations (still in its infancy). Through representation techniques for general (nonlinear) operators that enjoy a global comparison principle, the principal investigators hope to bridge the gap between some aspects of these previously disjoint classes of equations and to use this ""nonlocal"" bridge as a pathway to new discoveries.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1700307","Nestor","Guillen","nguillen@math.umass.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Hadley","010359450","4135450698","Research Administration Building","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research will address a central paradox in sociological research about how information technology is changing society: while the internet is a force of liberation, e.g. because it helps people organize social activities across time and distance at low cost, the same communication technology extends existing power structures, e.g. through large-scale surveillance of dissenting citizens. By studying clashes between these two forces--in this case represented by internet-mediated crime on the one hand and law enforcement operations on the other--the project explores the unintended consequences of social control work in the digital age, as targeted groups struggle to overcome the efforts to halt them. Investigating the consequences of long-standing criminal justice methods in digital markets for banned goods and services will inform the ongoing debate on drug policy reform, and more broadly, expand the knowledge of the policing of social behavior. The proposed project will advance research on illegal markets ? directly through the undertaken research, and indirectly by making all quantitative data on trade patterns publicly available for other researchers. <br/><br/>In 2014, the Co-PI interviewed a British man who had been running a ""largeish"" drug dealing operation for ""quite a few years"", specializing in opium and cannabis. A recent shift to e-commerce had transformed his business. ""Our goals are different [now]."" In digital markets, ""you can make structured plans, attainable goals, you can expand in a controlled manner."" Another interviewee said he had no prior experience with drug trade before he started vending online. He explained at the time that he has no face-to-face interaction with customers or suppliers--he produces his chemical drugs in his home kitchen, processes all orders through the internet, and sends his meticulously packed products by conventional postal services. His plan is to remain strictly digital, he said. ""I have no contact with any milieu where I can sell my products, outside of the internet. I have no desire to risk exposure in milieus the police might know of."" The two vendors were active in a market that has since been shut down by law enforcement, but both continued to do business in other markets. This project asks, how is digital trade of illegal goods and services organized, and how are market actors adapting to law enforcement?s efforts to stop them? Drawing on quantitative data collected from digital markets for banned goods and services, the research details how the markets successfully organize trade on a scale that was, until recently, only possible for criminal syndicates with access to military, political and economic capital, and how the trade continued after several law enforcement crackdowns. To explain why and how vendors and customers continued their banned activities in the face of law enforcement, interviews with customers and vendors will be conducted.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1702919","Stephen","Pfohl","pfohl@bc.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Boston College","Chestnut Hill","024673800","6175528000","140 Commonwealth Avenue","United States","Massachusetts","MA","1331","SOCIOLOGY","1331","SOCIOLOGY","7434","CNCI","9179","GRADUATE INVOLVEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Isak","Ladegaard","isak.ladegaard@bc.edu","04/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","8060",NA,NA,NA,"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DeWeaver","Day-to-day weather over much of the world is driven by extratropical cyclones traveling along the storm tracks of the middle latitudes. Accurate weather forecasts thus require numerical models with high enough resolution to represent critical details of the cyclones and their evolution, and it is important to understand what constitutes adequate resolution for this purpose. Adequate resolution is likewise required to produce simulations which capture the response of cyclones and storm tracks to changes in global temperature, but it is again unclear what constitutes adequate resolution. This is particularly an issue as the expense of such simulations increases strongly with resolution.<br/><br/>Previous work by the PIs suggests that high resolution is necessary to represent small pockets of intense precipitation within the cyclones that promote cyclone intensification and produce more energetic cyclones. In addition, cyclones in the high resolution simulations are more intense under warmer conditions, due to the increase in latent heating that accompanies the rise in specific humidity with temperature. But these results are somewhat inconclusive as the simulations were performed with a regional model due to lack of access to global models with adequate resolution.<br/><br/>This project addresses the role of small-scale precipitation features in the intensification of cyclones, and the resulting potential for more energetic cyclones in a warming climate, using high-resolution simulations carried out as part of the United Kingdom UPSCALE project (UPSCALE is short for UK on PRACE - weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk, where PRACE is the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe). The UPSCALE project has produced global simulations at medium and high resolutions (up to 25km), both for present-day climate conditions and for warmer climates which are projected to occur due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The simulations are ideally suited for the PIs' research although they were produced for other reasons.<br/><br/>The project is funded through the RAPID mechanism to expedite the research so that it can be conducted according to the timeline of the ongoing UK project. A key issue in the timing is that UPSCALE is a precursor to the more intensive PRIMAVERA project, which will produce global simulations with resolutions as high as 5km. PRIMAVERA is the European contribution to the HighResMIP sub-project of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6), which will inform the next assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Near-term results of this project can thus play a critical role in defining the research agenda of PRIMAVERA and informing the assessment report.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the dominant influence of extratropical cyclones on sensible weather over the US and other midlatitude regions, and the value of guidance regarding possible increases in cyclone intensity due to climate change. The work also builds an international scientific collaboration which allows US PIs access to high-resolution simulations produced at substantial cost. In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation workforce in this research area.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1724566","Gary","Lackmann","gary@ncsu.edu","04/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator","North Carolina State University","RALEIGH","276957514","9195152444","CAMPUS BOX 7514","United States","North Carolina","NC","5740","CLIMATE & LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","5740","CLIMATE & LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS","7914","RAPID","8012","CR, Earth System Models",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Walter","Robinson","walter_robinson@ncsu.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","8012",NA,NA,NA,"CR, Earth System Models",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The workshop will be held at the University of Oregon in Corvallis, Oregon, July 9-14, 2017. As our existing infrastructure continues to age, it is of utmost importance to reliably assess and predict the performance of the remaining service life of existing assets. Computational modeling based on fundamental physics theories can be a powerful tool in achieving these goals while it can also be applicable to new constructions to optimize the materials selection and formulation for a desirable design life. Currently, courses related to material deterioration analysis and service life prediction modeling in the graduate civil engineering curriculum are scarce or limited to few institutions. This workshop offers a teaching model that can overcome this challenge. The course will be taught by a group of faculty members (national and international) with relevant research expertise. The outcomes of this course will enable civil engineering graduate students to gain fundamental knowledge related to service-life prediction and to integrate course materials into their current research. <br/><br/>The objective of this workshop is to enhance graduate student learning and research efforts by infusing the basic science and theory to model and predict concrete performance. Students will be introduced to reactive-transport modeling of multi-species and multi-mechanistic transport in concrete; coupled modeling of corrosion propagation of embedded reinforcement and recent developments in coupling reactive processes, which are quantified using thermodynamic modeling, with numerical solutions of extended Nernst-Plank equation for multi-species transport. Basic thermodynamic modeling principles, Gibbs Free Energy Minimization processes and introduce open-source algorithms (e.g. GEMS framework) and thermodynamic databases (e.g. CEMDATA) that use this approach will also be explored. In addition, students will have hands on experience with different analytical equipment to evaluate laboratory and field aged cement and concrete samples. The instructors will incorporate the verification of prediction models using analytical results from those test data. Effective technical communication including proposal writing skills will also be introduced to the graduate students.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1740540","Jason","Ideker","jason.ideker@oregonstate.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Oregon State University","Corvallis","973318507","5417374933","OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY","United States","Oregon","OR","1637","Structural and Architectural E","036E","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","039E","STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS","040E","Haz mitigation of structural sys","1057","CIS BASE RESEARCH","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","CVIS","CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE","Burkan","Isgor","burkan.isgor@oregonstate.edu","04/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Of the 22 species that are currently recognized, all are considered at least Threatened or Near-Threatened, and 9 are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Because of the decline in albatross populations and the birds' role as a top predator in the pelagic ecosystem, it is vitally important to understand the factors affecting the population dynamics of these birds to better inform strategies for conservation and mitigating environmental change. The goal of this project is to answer the question: What are the population consequences of albatross bioenergetics and foraging strategies? The investigators will take a two pronged approach: 1) constructing, parameterizing, and validating an Individual Based Model (IBM) that rests on Dynamic Energy Budget theory and state dependent foraging theory; and 2) undertaking an in-depth meta-analysis of existing individual tracking and life history data from multiple albatross species across successive life stages. This theoretical work will be grounded with a unique and extensive data set on albatrosses provided by collaborator Richard Phillips from the British Antarctic Survey. The IBM approach will incorporate details such as adult energetic state, chick needs and energetics, reproductive stage, and spatial and temporal variation in prey availability within a single framework. This facilitates exploration of emergent patterns, allowing the investigators to explicitly link behavior, energetic, and population dynamics.<br/><br/>Bioenergetics constrain a variety of behaviors. A more complete understanding of how individuals use energy can give insight into how behaviors from foraging to breeding and survival, and resulting population attributes, might change with environmental factors, due to anthropogenic and other drivers. This work will further a general understanding of how bioenergetics shapes behavior and drives population level processes, while providing an approach that can be used to guide conservation strategies for endangered populations. The research findings and activities will be made accessible to public audiences through websites and on a blog maintained for the project by a postdoctoral researcher. The project will involve undergraduate and high school researchers in the project, within formal laboratory groups and also through in-classroom presentations and activities. This project also involves outreach to local elementary schools, as the albatross-Antarctic bioenergetics system provides a charismatic and tangible teaching tool, for exploring a complex conservation issue, and demonstrating the utility of quantitative biological research approaches.

Even after the impact of the acidic mine effluents are removed by treatment, the streambeds themselves will continue to release metals that are toxic to aquatic species. The metal-containing sediments must be naturally removed in order for the stream to recover and allow both restoration of aquatic life and beneficial use by society. The sediments consist primarily of very small nanoparticles of iron oxide that can contain As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. These small particles, which have stuck to the streambed, may be more quickly removed if they become more stable in water due to changes in the chemistry of their surfaces. A treatment plant that removes the metals and acid from the mine effluents has just begun operation. The treatment process also alters the composition of the stream water in such a way that the particles may become more stable in water and, thus, removed more quickly. This study will provide data that will lead to better estimates of how quickly other streams will recover if similar mine waste treatment is performed. <br/><br/>Incidental nanoparticulate iron oxides (NP-FeOx) are formed in streams receiving acidic mine waters. NP-FeOx is capable of transporting contaminant metals such as Cu, Zn, and As. In early 2017 a lime treatment plant will go online in the North Fork of Clear Creek (NFCC), which will dramatically alter the water chemistry of the stream. The colloidal stability of NP-FeOX is dependent on solution composition (ionic strength, divalent cations, pH, DOC) and is thus likely to be affected. The project goal is to understand how the removal of metals will be influenced by changes in the stability of the NP-FeOx. In order to determine the immediate impact of the water treatment plant (WTP) on NP-FeOx stability in the water column, the dispersion of existing NP-FeOx contained in the streambed will be studied using spICP-MS, DLS, zeta potential, and ICP-OES. It is expected that preexisting NP-FeOX will disperse from the creek bed into the water during early WTP operation, which may result in a temporary increase in toxic metal concentrations. This will be of long-term benefit, as this process may accelerate the restoration of the streambed. This is the first time that nanoparticle stability under variable water chemistry conditions has been examined in an actual stream setting. Additionally, the manipulation of pH and hardness in laboratory experiments will allow us to understand the effects of isolated water chemistry variables on particle dispersion in an AMD system. A summer field session aimed at local high school students and college seniors at the Colorado School of Mines will participate in a field session at the study site. In addition, a partnership with the Upper Clear Creek Watershed Foundation will be forged to involve community volunteers on the proposed project.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1736102","James","Ranville","jranvill@mines.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","Colorado School of Mines","Golden","804011887","3032733000","1500 Illinois","United States","Colorado","CO","1179","Biol & Envir Inter of Nano Mat","7914","RAPID",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nitrogen fertilizer production helps meet this need. However, adding excess nitrogen drastically alters natural habitats such as salt marshes and others that receive water as runoff from land. Coastal wetlands provide several ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish and birds, storm surge protection, and nutrient filtration. Prior studies suggest that excess nitrogen may increase decomposition in these sediments, resulting in faster degradation of complex organic matter to carbon dioxide. What controls these processes, and the micro-organisms responsible for them is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of added nitrogen on organic matter decomposition. This research will provide an in-depth analysis of the members of the salt marsh microbiome and their activities in marsh sediments. Data will provide insight into how salt marshes are responding to nitrogen fertilizer runoff, information that is essential for the adaptive management of coastal wetland systems and their response to environmental change. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled flow through reactor systems to investigate the mechanistic effect of nitrate on microbial decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter. We hypothesize that, because nitrate is a favorable electron acceptor in heterotrophic, microbial respiration, it can promote oxidation of organic matter that would otherwise remain unprocessed. Current biogeochemical data indicate a significant increase in microbial respiration, particularly denitrification, in response to nitrate addition, with the most pronounced effect in deep sediments ranging from 150 to 200 years old. This is significant, because organic matter at this depth is typically thought to be more resistant to microbial degradation, which means that the capacity of salt marshes to store carbon may lessen with eutrophication. To further assess these results, we need to gain a better understanding of the microbial consortia responsible for organic matter decomposition. Microbial activity plays a critical role in controlling how much carbon is decomposed; though we know little about salt marsh sediment microbiome structure and function, and how it may change in response to nitrate addition. Accordingly, this dissertation improvement grant will contribute to existing data by taking an integrated 'meta-omics' approach. To complement flow through reactor experiments, the microbial genetic underpinnings of organic matter decomposition under conditions of nutrient enrichment will be investigated using metagenomics, and the metabolic activity of these microbial players will be assessed by measuring the expression of the microbial metatranscriptome. These data have the potential to reveal novel microbial lineages from deep salt marsh sediment, and draw unique linkages between microbial gene expression patterns and changes in organic carbon quality.

Greenspan","With every passing day, the Internet becomes more and more integrated in society. Our reliance on online web services in our professional and personal lives continuously increases. Recognizing this, attackers take advantage of the web's popularity to mount a wide range of web application attacks, compromising systems, and stealing private and financial information. Although many classes of these attacks are seemingly unrelated, in reality, many of them stem from the stateless nature of the web, where no safeguards exist to ensure that a resource that was linked to yesterday is the same resource being accessed today. As a result, enforcing link integrity holds the promise of mitigating a multitude of security attacks.<br/><br/>However, the dynamicity of the web poses challenges to link integrity schemes, which must cope with constant benign changes while flagging the malicious ones. Pursuing this line of research requires a fundamental understanding of the security aspects of the web?s dynamic nature. This nature cannot be assessed today with the available tools, because existing web crawlers are limited to retrieving content, and generally do not gather the metadata critical to the development of link integrity schemes. This project aims to quantify the stability of web links by developing a custom web crawler infrastructure and tools that will collect security-related metadata about remote resources. The gathering and subsequent assessing of this metadata is a critical first step to demonstrate the feasibility of developing robust link integrity schemes that can be used to detect abnormal content and infrastructure changes (indicative of an ongoing attack) while keeping false positives to a minimum.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1735396","Nick","Nikiforakis","nick@cs.stonybrook.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","SUNY at Stony Brook","Stony Brook","117940001","6316329949","WEST 5510 FRK MEL LIB","United States","New York","NY","8060","Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","025Z","SaTC: Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace","7434","CNCI","7916","EAGER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michael","Ferdman","mferdman@cs.stonybrook.edu","04/17/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The conference theme is Integrating Environment and Health. It will be an opportunity for STEM researchers, educators, and students in higher education, K-12, and informal education to gather with leaders from business, industry, government, and civil society working in the fields of environment and health to develop a common vision, share best practices, and develop new partnerships in order to advance the convergence of environmental and health sciences and engineering.<br/><br/>The health of people and the health of the planet are intrinsically, intricately, and intimately interconnected, but separate disciplines and professions have developed each with their own programs and terminology that even use similar terms such as environmental health or environmental health sciences differently. The 2017 conference seeks to advance convergence towards an approach to prepare scientists, educators, and practitioners to explore and understand the connections and apply them in their professional activities. The conference will be: 1. A forum for scholars, educators, students, professionals and policymakers to share new science, best practices, and develop new partnerships. 2. An opportunity for academics to gather with leaders from business, industry, government, and civil society to raise the profile and expand the effectiveness of scholarship that connects health and environment. 3. An arena to help scientists and policymakers consider how research can inform and be translated into policy and practices. 4. A platform designed to catalyze new initiatives and partnerships. One of the conference's primary purposes is to help build a convergent interdisciplinary field of environment and health. Desired outcomes include: 1. Helping to build communities of practice in environment and health utilizing collaborative approaches to identify critical scientific and technological needs, learning outcomes, and effective practices in key areas. 2. An avenue for enhanced STEM literacy for students in all disciplines based on critical thinking about health and its relationships with various environmental issues (climate change, pollution, international security, environmental capital and the value (cost) of nature as it relates to health impacts, and other challenges of modern society). 3. New pathways for teaching about environment and health. 4. Stronger research programs that more effectively take innovations in science and technology to the demonstration and deployment stages. The project will help advance a broadly-defined, interdisciplinary field of environment and health that includes elements of science, technology, policy, ethics, environmental, health and biomedical sciences. A broader integration of environment and health science will serve society helping to elucidate the health benefits of environmental protection, extend the relevance and practicality of STEM education, and forge critical connections with research on health and the environment. The impacts of the project will be evaluated through electronic surveys during and at the conclusion of the conference and a follow-up survey six months after the conference as well as a post-conference discussion with the conference planning committee.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1703140","David","Blockstein","david@ncseonline.org","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","National Council for Science and the Environment/CEDD","Washington","200364722","2025305810","1101 17th Street N.W Suite 250","United States","District of Columbia","DC","1440","ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","8209","Improv Undergrad STEM Ed(IUSE)","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1998",NA,NA,NA,"IUSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Patino","The University of Maryland has been granted an award to host a workshop entitled ""Early Career Geoscience Faculty: Teaching, Research, and Managing Your Career"", in July 2017. The goal of this five-day workshop is to provide concrete skills to support faculty in the early years of their teaching and research responsibilities. The participants will learn about discipline-based educational research, share ideas and strategies for teaching, consider successful strategies for maintaining an active research and scholarly practice, discuss life as an early-career faculty member, and leave with materials and tools for managing their career in academia. Influencing faculty at the beginning of their careers can have a career-long impact, as well as a notable, secondary impact on improving Geoscience education and mentoring. The networks that will form at the workshop will serve to alleviate common feelings of overload and isolation expressed by early career faculty. Previous workshops have indicated that faculty benefit from hearing tips from other professors; developing a network of support; and in making strategic research, teaching, and management plans for the first several years of their academic careers. The funds from this award will provide resources to implement the workshop and to support scholarships for participants whose institutions are not able to support their participation. This workshop is offered in partnership with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) On the Cutting Edge program of professional development workshops. <br/><br/>The workshop will advocate for best practices in pedagogy for participants. In that vein, the workshop leaders will model effective pedagogical practices during the workshop, for example active learning techniques and incorporating time for reflection. Leaders will engage the participants actively throughout the workshop using a variety of methods including small and large group discussions, short problem-solving tasks, reviewing and/or trying out activities, and scheduled thinking and writing time.","04/17/2017","04/17/2017","1711022","Sarah","Penniston-Dorland","sarahpd@umd.edu","04/17/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Maryland College Park","COLLEGE PARK","207425141","3014056269","3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive","United States","Maryland","MD","1572","TECTONICS","4444","INTERDISCIPLINARY PROPOSALS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1573","1574","1575","1577","PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY","GEOPHYSICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GLOBAL CHANGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1579","HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES","1580","INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES",NA,NA,"1690","EDUCATION/HUMAN RESOURCES,OCE","7295","GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM","7459","SEDIMENTARY GEO & PALEOBIOLOGY","7699","ICER","7700","EDUCATIONAL LINKAGES"

Spengler","Hospital clinical laboratory tests are a major source of medical information used to diagnose, treat, and monitor patients. Such test errors lead to delays, additional clinical evaluation, additional expense, and sometimes to erroneous treatments that increase risk to patients. One recent study suggests that errors in measured total blood calcium concentration due to instrument mis-calibration alone cost from $60M to $199M annually in the US. However, the vast majority of clinical laboratory errors do not originate in instrument mis-calibration. Clinical laboratory errors affect about 0.5% of samples collected. Of those, approximately 75% of clinical laboratory test errors originate during sample collection, transport, and storage before samples reach the analysis instruments i.e., the pre-analytic phase. However the quality control measures standard in hospital clinical test labs only monitor instrument calibration and are therefore completely blind to sample faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase, where most errors originate. Data derived from patient samples, rather than instrumentation calibration checks, holds the key to detect faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase. Current methods are either so insensitive to errors that they do not detect sample faults reliably, or they routinely flag normal samples as being faulty.<br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Oregon Health and Science University and Northeastern University with expertise in machine learning, signal processing, and laboratory medicine to develop and apply statistical machine learning technology to reliably detect errors in hospital clinical laboratory tests, using data derived from patient samples. The primary obstacle to developing reliable statistical detectors for lab errors is the cost of labeling samples combined with the low error rate. Developing and evaluating any automated error-detection algorithm requires a sufficient number of samples, both faulty and non-faulty. Determining which tests are faulty requires review of the tests and other patient data (e.g. charts) by a clinical lab expert - a time-consuming and economically unfeasible prospect given the low fault rate. The project addresses this challenge through active learning paradigms used to select, with emphasis on rare classes, subsets of the data for labeling by human experts. The project focuses on chronic kidney disease because of its medical importance and large data repository at Oregon Health and Science University. This research will provide algorithms for clinical lab error detection that will extend to tests used in other disease entities (for example diabetes and heart failure). <br/><br/>Ultimately, the error-detection algorithms developed from this research will make their way into clinical laboratory information systems and further into commercialization and thus deployment on a scale significant enough to have widespread positive impact on laboratory costs patient risk. The project provides cross-disciplinary training in statistical pattern recognition and clinical laboratory science for graduate and undergraduate students.

Corby Hovis","This project will offer a workshop that will enhance the impact of the ongoing ""*Science* in the Classroom (SitC)"" project (NSF Awards DUE-1043998, DUE-1224661, and DUE-1525596). SitC is developing a collection of new educational resources -- richly annotated versions of research articles from the journal *Science* -- along with methods and guides to help undergraduate STEM educators use these resources effectively in their classrooms. This approach uses leading-edge research both to teach STEM concepts and to excite students about the frontiers of science. Through the workshop, the SitC project team will provide a foundation for teaching the nature and practices of science, in the context of SitC resources, to college and university faculty, pre-service teachers, graduate students, postdocs, and other STEM professionals, and the workshop will allow the SitC project to leverage the expertise of the participants to develop educator guides for SitC resources. The workshop will have three primary benefits: (1) Participants will learn how to develop high-quality educator guides focusing on the nature of science and scientific practices, a skill that is useful for STEM education but is also transferable to a wide variety of STEM careers. (2) Through the new educator guides, which will be freely available on the Web, the workshop will increase the accessibility of annotated primary literature resources that have been vetted by educational experts. (3) Focusing on the nature and practices of science in a teaching context has been shown to contribute to the improvement of essential research skills. Therefore, participants in the workshop may improve their own research skills and become better scientists.<br/><br/>The project will encourage adoption of education research in the practice of teaching in the STEM disciplines. This adoption will take place at two levels. First, members of the undergraduate STEM education community will be provided a professional development opportunity in using primary literature to teach the nature and practices of science. Successful completion of the workshop should result in greater understanding of the benefits of teaching the nature and practices of science. Recent research has shown that when teaching in the context of inquiry-based thinking rooted in the nature of science, graduate students and postdocs reinforced their own learning and, by extension, became better researchers. Therefore, providing the undergraduate STEM education community with a foundation for teaching the nature and practices of science will also improve the quality of the research training and science careers participants are involved in. The second level of adoption will result from the educator guides that participants will produce as part of the workshop. These guides will accompany SitC resources and will be freely available to STEM educators via the Web.","04/18/2017","04/18/2017","1712039","Shirley","Malcom","smalcom@aaas.org","04/18/2017","Principal Investigator","American Association For Advancement Science","WASHINGTON","200053928","2023266400","1200 NEW YORK AVENUE, N.W.","United States","District of Columbia","DC","1998","IUSE","8209","Improv Undergrad STEM Ed(IUSE)","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Melissa","McCartney","mmccartn@fiu.edu","04/18/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The workshop focuses on topics in the intersections of FDA, infinite-dimensional differential geometry, and data-driven applications, and will feature both senior experts and junior researchers from these areas. The workshop includes a half-day of tutorials providing an introduction to the workshop topics, especially aimed at junior researchers. The remaining time will be allocated to invited talks, a poster session, and discussion sessions. The main motivation for this workshop is to initiate and facilitate discussions and future collaborations between US scientists and mathematicians with different backgrounds and expertise. The organizers will strive for breadth and diversity by targeting leading experts in the three components areas of the workshop -- geometry, FDA, and big data analysis. The poster session will be used to encourage all participants, especially the junior researchers, to present their research and interact with others. <br/><br/>A rapid growth of functional data in all disciplines, ranging from natural and social sciences to engineering and technology, has made FDA an important topic of research. To handle the diverse challenges facing FDA, there is a need to exploit low-dimensional patterns and structures present in functional data. Geometry provides tools to: (1) extract and analyze structures in functional data, (2) handle the infinite-dimensionality of function spaces, (3) arrive at viable statistical models and make efficient inferences; and (4) process large datasets associated with many current and future data-centric applications. The workshop will include both: (1) theoretical topics, such as geometries of infinite-dimensional spaces, analysis under invariant metrics, and statistical models involving functional data; and (2) applications, such as computational anatomy, bioinformatics, biometrics, and neuroscience. This blend of important and complementary topics makes the workshop a unique and worthwhile event.

The project will test hypotheses that advantageous positions in community-wide social networks allow some households to aggregate wealth more quickly than their peers, and it will explore mechanisms for these emerging disparities. The project will provide new insights regarding the origins and effects of income inequality on measures of individual well-being as well as to the heterogeneous mechanisms through which relatively egalitarian societies exhibit increases in the distribution of wealth within communities. Through the conduct of research using consistent methods across a broad range of site, the project will facilitate the education, training, and mentoring of early-career scholars in data acquisition and analysis. The project will result in new software for analyses using this kind of approach that will be made available for use by others through an open-source platform. Because the project will include assessments of how economic factors and policy decisions that affect the structure of networks are likely to impact the long-run distribution of wealth, project findings can assist in the design of policies and interventions to reduce inequality by fostering particular ties within a community.<br/><br/>To assess how connections within social networks affect wealth distributions over time, the investigators will collect data in 25 locations across the globe. The data will be collected regarding who is connected to whom and what their level of wealth is at the beginning of the study and four years later. The study sites exhibit geographic and socioecological diversity, and the researchers will examine communities that includes hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, wage laborers, and intensive agriculturalists as well as varying degrees of involvement with market economies and national political systems. Data regarding network, wealth, and household characteristics will be analyzed to determine whether and how networks matter in determining outcomes of wealth and inequality. The investigators also will test the idea that bargaining power depends on social connections.

Lukin","This project will utilize a facility called Plasma Krystal-4 (PK-4) on the International Space Station to conduct experiments in microgravity investigating the underlying physics of large amplitude waves. Waves are moving oscillations, which can propagate in many substances. In some substances waves are easily visible, in some they are easily manipulated, and in some the waves attain a large displacement so that they take on a different character called nonlinearity. Attaining all three of these characteristics at the same time is possible in a substance called a dusty plasma, which is a mixture of highly charged micron-size solid particles immersed in a partially ionized gas consisting of electrons, ions, and neutral molecules. In this project, large amplitude waves will be observed using video microscopy and manipulated using an experimental instrument on the International Space Station. An undergraduate student will carry out the analysis. The topic has an overlap with other fields of research including nonlinear dynamics as well as other plasma physics areas outside of dusty plasmas.<br/><br/>The data to be analyzed are mainly from the PK-4 instrument, which is a European-Russian apparatus now on the International Space Station. Data returned to Earth are distributed to scientists at other locations including The University of Iowa. A scientific video camera images a cross-section of a cloud of polymer microspheres, which are electrically charged due to their immersion in a weakly ionized plasma. This so-called dust cloud sustains waves such as dust acoustic wave and ionization striations; these waves grow naturally, by an instability, to attain nonlinear amplitudes. The use of data from PK-4 is valuable because under microgravitiy conditions, the dust cloud fills a three-dimensional volume of greater size than is possible in laboratory experiments on Earth. To support this effort the investigators will collaborate with theorists in describing the nonlinear motion.

This meeting is the 53rd in a sequence of annual conferences. Its purpose is to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress. The conference focuses on young researchers, placing them in close proximity to leaders in the field for person-to-person interactions in a manner not possible at most other meetings. Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. With the travel support provided by this award, students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers.<br/><br/>The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, with member programs at 45 universities in 16 states in the region. This project will fund student participation in the 2017 Summer Research Conference (SRC) sponsored by SRCOS. The meeting is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller schools in the region, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant venues. It will strengthen the research of the statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the relatively underdeveloped southern region.

Solutions to this system of equations can develop singularities from regular initial data; some such singularities are inside a black hole event horizon. A fundamental mathematical question concerns understanding how such singularities arise from generic initial data. In particular, this project explores questions that include: What does the boundary of the interior of black holes look like? Are they always singular? Are there singularities that are not in the black hole regions? These are questions that the strong and weak cosmic censorship conjectures in general relativity seek to address -- study of those conjectures is the central motivation for this project.<br/><br/>A particular focus of the project is to understand the singular boundary of the interior of black holes and also to understand sharp criteria under which trapped surfaces (structures closely related to black holes) may form. Recent work of the investigator and collaborators provides a resolution of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture for the Einstein-Maxwell (real) scalar field in spherical symmetry, showing that solutions arising from generic data have singular black hole interiors, in the sense that the spacetime metric cannot be extended in a suitably regular manner. This project aims to extend these results to settings without symmetry assumptions, in particular to give a complete description of the boundary of black holes that arise from perturbations of the explicit Kerr solutions. In a different direction, this project also aims to establish criteria that guarantee that trapped surfaces form, as a step towards understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in general relativity.","04/18/2017","04/18/2017","1709458","Jonathan","Luk","jluk@stanford.edu","04/18/2017","Principal Investigator","Stanford University","Palo Alto","943041212","6507232300","3160 Porter Drive","United States","California","CA","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Akkara","Non-Technical:<br/>This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Akron is to study conjugated polymers that have attracted significant interests for different applications to improve the performance of bio-electronic devices. However, conventional conjugated polymers are not able to provide all required functions. The goal of this project is to address key challenges of conjugated polymers for different applications by developing a new zwitterionic conjugated polyelectrolyte platform. This new biomaterial platform could have potential to be translated into clinical applications to benefit public health. The proposed project includes multidisciplinary knowledge from chemistry, physics, materials science and biology to device fabrication and testing. Thus, proposed activities will provide excellent educational and outreach opportunities for K-12 students and teachers, undergraduates and graduate students. The PI plans to expose K-12 students and their teachers to cutting edge and multidisciplinary biotech and biomedical techniques. The core of the proposed education plan is project/problem-based learning, since it is a more effective learning approach. Students, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and women, will be actively recruited to conduct research in this project. The proposed work will help promote the development of a high-tech environment in northeast Ohio through this science and engineering education.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of this research is to develop a versatile zwitterionic conjugated polyelectrolyte (CP) platform to address key challenges of conjugated polymers for biomedical applications. Zwitterionic CPs, consisting of conjugated backbones and multifunctional zwitterionic side chains, will integrate all essential functions and tunable properties into one material. Zwitterionic materials will gain tunable conducting, optical and antimicrobial properties through conjugated backbones. Low-biocompatible conjugated polymers will obtain outstanding biocompatibility, controllable antifouling properties and sensitivity to environmental stimuli via side chains. The proposed work will provide valuable insights into polymer chemistry and physics of both conjugated and zwitterionic polymers. It will foster a new multidisciplinary research area in the field of biomaterials. With this project, the PI plans to build a set of design rules to guide in creating advanced biomaterials for the future. The proposed research activities will provide great educational and outreach opportunities to stimulate K-12 students' interest in science and technology, and motivate students to face the challenges of interdisciplinary research activities.

To support the progress of geobiology as an integrated discipline, this project funds participation by U.S.-based scientists in the inaugural conference of the Geobiology Society, scheduled for June 11-14, 2017, in Banff, Canada, a world-famous geobiological destination in its own right. Recognizing that a single, international, community-building conference was critically needed to bring together this first generation of self-identifying geobiologists, the Geobiology Society designed this conference to promote the exchange of ideas, tools, and expertise with emphasis on contributions from early-career scientists (newly hired assistant professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students). Reducing participation costs for U.S.-based scientists, who will make up ~70% of the estimated 350 total participants, is a key part of the Geobiology Society's plan to ensure accessibility to this initial meeting, which will in turn seed its long-term sustainability. The society's pledge to sustaining these inclusive, community-building efforts for all stages of scientific experience is in itself a broader impact. In addition, each student attendee will prepare a digital poster presentation to be bundled into an online conference proceedings volume that will be made publically available on the Geobiology Society website.<br/><br/>Leading scientists from both geochemistry and geophysics have recognized the need to bring together scientists with different backgrounds to enhance cross-disciplinary communication. Yet a recent NSF-sponsored workshop on Geomicrobiology and Microbial Geochemistry (October 2013) identified barriers to exchange of relevant information (e.g., on methodologies) among different sub-disciplines as one of the main obstacles to advancing the field of geobiology. Although expertise in any given aspect of geobiology requires specialized training, it is the cross-fertilization among these seemingly disparate fields that defines geobiology, and highlights the need for this shared conference. Because a major goal of this conference is to facilitate bridge building across the disparate fields that define geobiology, particularly from the geological and biological ends of the spectrum, morning programs will be devoted to a single series of oral sessions that all participants will attend; there will be no overlapping or conflicting sessions. The first two full days will explore the modern tools of organic and inorganic geochemistry, molecular biology, microbial ecology, sedimentary geology, and paleontology. The third full day will focus on interpretations of the rock record, including key studies of the modern world that enhance our ability to look back. The afternoons are designed for extended student poster sessions. Additionally, there will be informal talks offered during the poster sessions covering a range of topics, including data visualization, new technological advances in instrumentation, and tips for searching and securing a job.","04/18/2017","04/18/2017","1734126","Timothy","Lyons","timothy.lyons@ucr.edu","04/18/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Riverside","RIVERSIDE","925211000","9518275535","Office of Research","United States","California","CA","7295","GEOBIOLOGY & LOW TEMP GEOCHEM","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is significant because it uses the community for learning science of the environment, in an approach called Citizen Science or Participatory Science Research (PSR). The project will target learning outcomes for underrepresented middle and high school students in the urban and diverse East San Francisco Bay Area. The fundamental issues that will be studied deal with particulate matter (PM) in the local area. The project will generate information that contributes to better understanding the impact of a science curriculum with PSR activities on science learning. The project will provide opportunities for students at a total of 10 different middle and high school sites to engage in a broad range of activities where the students will collect, analyze, and disseminate data generated in local urban communities. An accompanying curriculum that includes new and previously tested skills development activities also will be produced and used to aid students in connecting PSR activities to inter-related topics such as: energy generation and use, global climate, environmental degradation, and community health (asthma, in particular). <br/><br/>The project will refine a theory of learning that makes more explicit the connections between science practices, identity, and value and relevance. The project will yield information useful in the future development of effective learning environments in urban areas, providing positive science education experiences to challenge students' previous notions and ways of relating to science. The students will learn how to identify with science by gaining a deeper understanding of science practices. They will learn how to analyze and interpret data; construct explanations; engage in argument from evidence; and obtain, evaluate and communicate information. The students will be collecting air samples which will be analyzed using an electron microscope. In conducting their research, students will use low cost, highly accurate AirBeam particle monitors and tablet devices to measure and georeference PM concentration levels as they travel within their schools and surrounding communities. These measurements will then be used to assess ventilation conditions within school buildings, and correlated with different transit routes and transportation systems in an attempt to assess exposure patterns associated with different modes of transit in a given area. The result will be an increase in the understanding of the relevance and the value of science in everyday life. The project will also yield high quality particulate matter data that will be useful for local environmental efforts as well as to public health and atmospheric scientists.","04/18/2017","04/18/2017","1720585","Kevin","Cuff","kcuff@berkeley.edu","04/18/2017","Principal Investigator","University of California-Berkeley","BERKELEY","947045940","5106428109","Sponsored Projects Office","United States","California","CA","7645","DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ardice","Hartry","hartry@berkeley.edu","04/18/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Matthew A.","Cannady","mcannady@berkeley.edu","04/18/2017","Co-Principal Investigator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, however, no research-based models are available to guide the development, characterization, and assessment of young children's algebraic thinking, particularly at the start of formal schooling. This study will design a curricular framework for developing children's algebraic thinking across Grades K-2, with a particular focus on understanding how to support the teaching and learning of algebra with students in at-risk settings. Study outcomes will include a prototype Grades K-2 instructional sequence, related assessments, and characterizations of progressions in students' thinking as they advance through the instructional sequence. The impact of this work would be to provide a critical roadmap for teaching and learning algebra in Grades K-2 that can clarify and deepen the role of algebra in the elementary grades, strengthen current college and career readiness standards and practices, and provide curricular support for elementary teachers in systematically developing children's algebraic thinking.<br/><br/>The study will use design research to develop and empirically test a K-2 Early Algebra Learning Progression prototype for diverse learners. The context for this study is a North Carolina elementary school, which consists of a student population that is 64% non-white, with 63% categorized as low SES and 27% as English Language Learners. The sample consists of approximately 60 Grades K-2 students. To empirically test the prototype's framework, learning goals, and instructional sequence, classroom teaching experiments (CTEs) will be conducted in conjunction with individual student interviews. These interviews will be conducted at three time points (pre, mid, and post) during the CTEs. Qualitative methods of analysis will be used to identify themes regarding children's understanding of core algebraic thinking practices and concepts in CTE and interview data. Quantitative methods will also be used to identify patterns of growth in students' algebraic thinking from interview data. Results will be used to refine the framework, goals, and sequence, as well as to identify levels of sophistication in children's thinking as they advance through the sequence. Interview assessments conducted during the CTEs will be analyzed for psychometric soundness to ensure they are valid and reliable. In particular, inter-rater reliability measures will be used to ensure that coding of interview data is consistent, internal consistency estimates of reliability will be calculated and used to remove or modify items, and stability of the assessment items will be examined through within-subject correlations of common items and used to remove or modify items. For validity, observed item difficulty will be correlated with predicted item difficulty by the project's expert advisory board to identify items that need modification or deletion.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Savannah State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project seeks to develop an autonomic security management framework and apply the framework to realize a self-protecting Healthcare Information System (HIS). The comprehensive self-protection system will enable HISs to autonomously assess their potential security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect realtime intrusions and react to cyber attacks, thus maintaining normal performance and enhancing patient data security and privacy. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of cyber security courses.<br/><br/>The research seeks to adopt computing technology to realize a Self-Protecting Healthcare Information System (SPHIS) that can autonomously assess system security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect real-time intrusions and react to cyber attacks with little or no human intervention. Eventually the SPHIS will maintain the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystem's normal performance and enhance patients' data security and privacy. An Internet of Things cyber security lab and Healthcare Information System cloud testbed will be built to validate the SPHIS autonomous feature and functions using real-world cyber attacks. The research will determine cyber attacks and use time series forecasting methods to initialize early warning modules and send attack alerts based on the variation of power utilization of IoMT devices. Power consumption of IoMT devices thus will be collected offline when the system is under normal and known cyber attack situations. The power data will be used to set up the IoMT ecosystem's normal behavior region by data mining techniques, and help to identify abnormal behaviors and detect cyber attacks using unsupervised learning techniques. The power data of IoMT devices will be collected online when the HIS is compromised by unknown attacks, and the power data will be analyzed by a network of forensics analysis tools. The attack patterns will be added to update the intrusion detection module. A dynamic intrusion response system will be developed to select the optimal prevention and protection mechanisms for mitigating cyber attacks. The research promises to change the current HIS cyber security state from poorly prepared to well defended against emerging cyber attacks. This research will also contribute to development of the cyber security workforce and enhance security awareness in healthcare organizations.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1700391","Qian","Chen","chenq@savannahstate.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Savannah State University","Savannah","314049703","9123584277","State College Branch","United States","Georgia","GA","1594","HIST BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIV","9178","UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This topic has long played a central role in mathematics, and it lies at the intersection of many fields of mathematics: the problems to be studied relate to wide variety of areas of mathematics, including topology, algebra, and number theory. The project will investigate a variety of situations in which unexpected symmetries of equations make it possible to explore otherwise difficult-to-understand geometric phenomena and to test a wide variety of geometric conjectures in new settings.<br/><br/>The particular emphasis of this project will be on the connections between algebraic geometry and algebraic dynamics, the study of iterated rational maps, and the results will include applications of each field to the other. On one hand, the investigator will work to understand how ideas from dynamics can be used to reveal a variety of otherwise obscure phenomena in higher-dimensional algebraic geometry, and he aims to demonstrate that varieties admitting dynamically interesting self-maps provide a fertile source of examples (and counterexamples). Conversely, the investigator will also work to understand how the methods of algebraic geometry (and the minimal model program in particular) can be employed to understand the geometric properties of algebraic varieties with very large groups of symmetries.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1700898","John","Lesieutre","jdl@uic.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Illinois at Chicago","Chicago","606124305","3129962862","809 S MARSHFIELD","United States","Illinois","IL","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Often these equations are algebraic in nature, such as those describing lines, circles, and parabolas. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions -- think about the equation defining a circle -- and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. One part of this research project addresses questions that have emerged in this endeavor. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to a mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a variety to a group, and in the past few years various researchers, including the investigator, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.<br/><br/>This research is rooted in commutative algebra, with applications also to the representation theory of finite group schemes in positive characteristic. The first part of the project concerns the homological aspects of modules over commutative rings. The problems posed range from those that have arisen from the internal developments in the subject to ones inspired by recent advances in the broader mathematical context, notably the representation theory of algebras and homotopy theory. The focus in the second part of the project is on the Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebras. Classically, Hochschild cohomology has been of interest for it is one of two main cohomology theories that capture properties of the diagonal morphism. A different aspect of Hochschild cohomology has begun to play an increasingly important role: Its action on derived categories, and various triangulated categories. The problems proposed in the second part of the project address both aspects. In recent years, notions and techniques from commutative ring theory have proved to be remarkably effective in solving problems in, and shedding new light on, the representation theory of finite groups over a field of positive characteristic. This project will develop these connections in new directions.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1700985","Srikanth","Iyengar","iyengar@math.utah.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Utah","SALT LAKE CITY","841128930","8015816903","75 S 2000 E","United States","Utah","UT","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Birkhoff in 1927. This mathematical dynamical system serves as a good approximation to several important physical systems, for instance, sound propagation inside of a chapel or a cathedral. This research project targets classical inverse problems for such dynamical systems, for example: if we know some properties of the particle's motion, can we infer properties of the underlying domain? This is closely related to the question, ""Can you hear the shape of a drum?"" That is, can one reconstruct the shape of a drum solely from the sound it produces? It turns out that properties of sound inside of a convex domain are closely related to properties of the possible trajectories of the associated reflecting particles inside of the same domain. This project aims to deepen understanding of related mathematical questions in the analysis of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study perturbations of convex billiards and to derive necessary conditions for integrability (for perturbation of ellipses) and for isospectrality of deformations of convex domains. The former condition is closely related to the phenomenon of whispering galleries and the Birkhoff conjecture about characterization of integrable billiards, while the latter problem is closely related to deformation spectral rigidity. M. Kac's question can be expressed in terms of the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation inside of a convex planar domain. Due to the wave trace function the Laplace spectrum generically determines the length spectrum of the associated billiard inside of the same domain and connects analysis with billiards. The second part of the project is about proving stochastic Arnold diffusion, that is, stochastic diffusing behavior for nearly integrable systems and the Chirikov conjecture. One of challenging goals is to establish stochastic diffusive behavior inside of Kirkwood gaps for the three-body problem.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1702278","Vadim","Kaloshin","vadim.kaloshin@gmail.com","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","University of Maryland College Park","COLLEGE PARK","207425141","3014056269","3112 LEE BLDG 7809 Regents Drive","United States","Maryland","MD","1281","ANALYSIS PROGRAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wiseman, Jr.","Changes in the climate of one part of the world can often be associated with changes in another part of the world. For example, on time scales of hundreds of years, coarse scale proxies indicate that the temperature of the North Atlantic region of the globe may change while the temperature of the South Atlantic region changes with the opposite sign. Models of this ""bipolar seesaw"" invoke the long-distance transmission (teleconnection) of information through the atmosphere or the ocean. The proposed work will use ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica to investigate the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections in coupling both hemispheres during so-called ""Heinrich events"" - massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic that happed repeatedly during the last ice age. The work will help climate scientists understand dynamical changes that occur on times scales that are much longer than observational records from weather stations. The project will also contribute to development of the STEM workforce. It will provide support for an early-career scientist during the formative years of his career. It will provide support for one or more undergraduate laboratory technicians and entrain undergraduates, supported through other sources, into the research. It will include STEM outreach to local middle school students and a teacher training program. It will result in a series of Wikipedia entries concerning paleoclimate. As an ancillary benefit, it will improve the chronology of the Greenland ice core to be studied. This will allow greater synchronization of paleoclimate records between the two poles and facilitate progress in the study of past climates.<br/><br/>The proposed work will generate high-resolution, high-precision records of Greenland (GISP2) ice core methane, 15N/14N ratio of molecular nitrogen, and air content for the period of 14-51 ka before present, to investigate a number of important paleoclimatic questions with a special focus on Heinrich stadials. The proposed work is organized under four overarching goals: (1) to detect the impact of Heinrich events on Greenland climate, and use the timing of these events relative to observed rapid Antarctic warming to investigate whether the mode of interhemispheric climate coupling during these events is via an atmospheric or an oceanic teleconnection; (2) to achieve interpolar methane synchronization of the GISP2 and WAIS Divide ice cores at unprecedented centennial-scale resolution, with applications in studying interhemispheric climate teleconnections and ice core dating.; (3) to provide the most accurate Greenland temperature reconstruction to date by combining nitrogen isotope data with independent delta-age estimates derived from the methane synchronization; and (4) to improve understanding of air content as a proxy for ice sheet elevation, and investigate origin of millennial-scale air content variations during Dansgaard-Oeschger events not previously described in the literature.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative algebras, which are mathematical objects that have operations of addition and multiplication; however, the multiplication may not be commutative: xy does not have to equal yx. The purpose of the project is to investigate a set of mathematical problems motivated by physics. More specifically, the motivation derives from a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry. The interdisciplinary nature of the research promotes further interaction between these fields. The project provides excellent opportunities for the investigator to work with young scientists and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other countries to promote scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry, one studies geometry via algebras of functions on noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative associative algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra. An important class of noncommutative manifolds can be obtained as deformations of commutative algebras. The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. This project will focus on the study of homotopy algebra structures in noncommutative geometry using tools from deformation quantization and Lie groupoid and Lie algebroid theory. The problems include exploring the Duflo and Todd type class, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem, and studying Tsygan noncommutative calculi in a general framework in terms of Lie algebroids.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1707545","Ping","Xu","ping@math.psu.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Pennsylvania State Univ University Park","UNIVERSITY PARK","168027000","8148651372","110 Technology Center Building","United States","Pennsylvania","PA","1264","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1267",NA,NA,NA,"TOPOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Szekely","This project aims at developing optimal deterministic methods for statistical sampling / statistical observations, in contrast to commonly-used random sampling methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MC/MCMC methods have revolutionized statistics, allowing statisticians to model and solve complex and high-dimensional problems that would have been intractable using conventional techniques. One drawback of these methods is that very many observations or data samples are needed due to the slow convergence rate inherent in random sampling. This becomes an issue when the sampling is expensive. The deterministic method under study in this project attempts to overcome this problem by sampling points more intelligently, so that the same information provided by a random sample can be obtained with fewer deterministic samples. This can significantly cut down the cost of sampling and subsequent computations. The method under development has applications in many fields, such as uncertainty quantification, computer experiments, and machine learning.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide deterministic samples obtained through the minimization of certain energies. The goal is to use carefully developed optimization techniques to reduce the number of expensive evaluations of a probability distribution, thereby reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the deterministic sample provides a much better representative set of points for the distribution, which can further reduce the cost of subsequent computations involving integrals. Compared to the existing Quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which are mostly developed for sampling from the uniform hypercube, the methods under study are much more general and can be used to directly sample from any probability distribution. Two methods for deterministic sampling will be investigated. The first method, known as minimum energy designs, is useful when the probability density is expensive to evaluate. The second method, known as support points, is useful when the integrand is expensive but sampling from the probability density is easy. The minimum energy design possesses an important property: its empirical distribution asymptotically converges to the target distribution. This is a property not shared by some of the competing representative point sets in the literature, such as principal points. On the other hand, support points are obtained by minimizing an energy distance which is used for goodness-of-fit testing. In this light, support points can be viewed as point sets that optimally compact a continuous probability distribution. The project focuses on developing efficient optimization methods for these energy functions using as few function evaluations as possible, and improving the distributional properties of the point sets so that they can be used in problems where MC/MCMC methods are computationally impracticable.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1712642","Roshan","Vengazhiyil","roshan@isye.gatech.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Atlanta","303320420","4048944819","Office of Sponsored Programs","United States","Georgia","GA","1269","STATISTICS","7433","CyberInfra Frmwrk 21st (CIF21)","8083","Big Data Science &Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this research project, questions related to estimation, computation, and uncertainty quantification in some structured regression models will be investigated. The imposed ""structure"" refers to known features (domain knowledge) of a system and helps to reduce the complexity of the fitted statistical model/procedure. Further, imposing such structures yields interpretable (yet flexible) models. Special emphasis is given to methods applicable to multivariate data, an area that has received relatively less attention, though often necessary in performing effective data analysis. Some of the methodological development undertaken in this project will address important scientific questions arising from astronomical data. The investigator also plans to continue the tradition of mentoring undergraduate summer interns and to participate in the NYU GSTEM outreach program, a six-week summer program for high school girls.<br/><br/>The three main topics pursued in this project are: (i) incorporating covariate information in multiple hypothesis testing problems; (ii) convexity constrained estimation and inference in regression models; and (iii) statistical methods that are geared towards detecting piecewise constant/affine structure in a (multivariate) regression function.

Further, a systematic theoretical study of these procedures, focusing on their adaptive (risk) properties, will be undertaken, and the important issues of inference and uncertainty quantification will be addressed. The intended applications of the research are diverse, ranging from estimation of radial velocity distribution of stars in a distant galaxy (astronomy), to developing methodology for detecting interactions between pairs of neurons (neuroscience), to estimating production and utility functions (economics), and to constructing confidence intervals for parameters in a continuous multivariate piecewise affine regression function (engineering).","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1712822","Bodhisattva","Sen","bodhi@stat.columbia.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Columbia University","NEW YORK","100276902","2128546851","2960 Broadway","United States","New York","NY","1269","STATISTICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Szekely","The project aims to develop new statistical methodologies for analysis of systems in a variety of fields, such as personalized medicine, internet traffic, and economics, in which sharp threshold effects occur. Such sharp effects are typically experienced when a system is subjected to a sudden shock (e.g., the effect of political tension on stock prices, the effect of socio-political upheaval on social-media networks, or the effect of a medical intervention on disease progression). Such sharp changes are of critical interest to practitioners in these different fields as they typically have important implications for future decision-making. Statisticians model such sharp changes in time, for example, through what are called ""change-points;"" when the sharp change happens due to the effect of multiple variables simultaneously, such regions are described in terms of ""change-planes."" This project aims to develop novel methods of identifying such change-points or change-planes in problems where massive amounts of data -- which have now become the norm given advances in storage capabilities as well as collection mechanisms -- are available, and furthermore, the number of variables on which data are recorded is also very large. The performance of such methods will be carefully analyzed using mathematical theory as well as computer-generated simulations, and the methods will also be validated on real data coming from a variety of sources. It is anticipated that the results of the research will have impact in a variety of natural science as well as social science disciplines. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of this project is to develop methodology and inference in a class of problems in which thresholds or boundaries (in one or multiple dimensions) that induce discontinuities arise naturally, either in the statistical model or in the estimation paradigm. The problems are studied both in the setting of massive amounts of data as well as in scenarios where the number of covariates can exceed the number of observations. The boundaries considered in one-dimension are change-points, while those in multiple dimensions are hyper-planes. The studied problems present two different kinds of complexities: (a) massive amounts of available data, and/or (b) large numbers of covariates relative to number of observations. In particular: (i) A number of ideas are developed for sampling intelligently from (retrospectively observed) long time-series to determine the locations of multiple change-points via procedures that require analyzing only a vanishing fraction of the entire series (thereby providing computational benefits), yet produce estimates that match, in precision, the standard estimates that would have been obtained analyzing the entire series. This idea is extended to regression/likelihood based models with covariates in multiple dimensions where the parameters of the regression or the likelihood are different on either side of a hyper-plane in covariate space. (ii) Problems involving hyper-planes, either in the structure of the model or in the criterion function to be optimized, with high-dimensional covariates are studied and new variable selection and estimation methods are investigated. The problems under consideration here are important from the perspective of applications but difficult because the high-dimensional paradigm has to be extended to intrinsically discontinuous settings, outside the (almost) square-root-n rate.

Climate, weather, and aquatic ecosystems such as streams and lakes are intimately connected to each other. This is especially true in mountain regions where glaciers as well as permanent and seasonal snowpack have major effects on physical (temperature), chemical (nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus), and biological (microbes, algae, fish) features of streams and lakes. However, mountain environments are experiencing very rapid changes in climate, even more pronounced than global averages. Since mountain regions are like humanity's ""water towers"", we need a better understanding of what these changing environmental conditions mean for the quantity and quality of our water supply. To best advance this understanding, scientists in different regions need to compare their findings and share their best practices of analysis and discovery. This project will support an intensive interdisciplinary workshop in which scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from the USA and China will meet to share data, develop collaborations, and make plans for further work to advance our understanding of how a changing alpine environment might affect lakes and streams and thus our water resources.<br/><br/>Ongoing climate variation is having major physical, chemical, and biological impacts on global ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems in mountain regions are especially impacted due to amplified temperature increases observed at high elevation and due to the sensitivity of key cryospheric components (glaciers, snowpack) to changes in temperature and precipitation. The ongoing changes in the cryosphere are widespread, complex, and affect a variety of key parameters for alpine lakes and streams such as temperature, transparency, discharge, and nutrient supply. The roles of natural variability versus external forcing in driving observed changes in snow and glacier distributions, as well as high elevation energy, water, weather, and biogeochemical cycles, need to be investigated. Documenting, understanding, and forecasting these impacts is challenging and requires broad interdisciplinary collaborations. To address these global challenges, this workshop will bring together experts in limnology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and hydrology as well as data science and mathematical modeling from both the USA and China to coordinate research, share key findings, identify major unanswered questions, and establish a network for future collaboration.

The conference focuses on the advancement of research in topology and outreach in mathematics, with specific emphasis on set-theoretic topology. Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.<br/><br/>This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems.

The primary audience for the conference is composed of graduate students, early-stage researchers as well as established professionals that would like to learn this new methodology. Through this type of training, early-career investigators will be able to develop future research directions that, in turn, will promote the advancement of the fields of petrology and tectonics. The conference will be held in the Washington State Convention Center, and will emphasize lecture-style presentations from experts in the discipline, and include a demonstration of data reduction software and possibly additional discussion time to identify areas of improvement of these methods. The first day will cover theory and analytical methods, and begin the systematic survey of relevant mineral systems. The second half-day will complete discussion of petrogenetically useful minerals and the presentation of useful software followed by discussion. Participants will be recruited from the broader communities interested in developing these new skills.<br/><br/>Petrochronology has emerged in the last 5-10 years as a preferred approach to geochronology, basically using chemistry and/or textures to integrate ages of individual crystals or crystal domains into a petrogenetic context. Examples in metamorphic systems include the use of crystal domain-specific trace element patterns or thermometers in minerals like zircon, monazite, titanite and garnet to link an age to an overall P-T-t evolution. Examples in igneous systems include resolution of crystal residence times, timing and rates of magma recharge, and rates of magma transport from zoning in quartz, olivine, feldspar, and melt (glass). Petrochronology directly benefits studies of tectonics, and metamorphic and igneous petrogenesis. It is expected that a corresponding book, published through ""Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry"", will provide an important foundation accessible to high-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and junior professional researchers who are interested in theory and applications within this burgeoning field.","04/19/2017","04/19/2017","1740555","Matthew","Kohn","mattkohn@boisestate.edu","04/19/2017","Principal Investigator","Boise State University","Boise","837250001","2084261574","1910 University Drive","United States","Idaho","ID","1572","TECTONICS","7556","CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS","9150","EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1573",NA,NA,NA,"PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
